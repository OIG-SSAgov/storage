  Executive Overview<br>
  <br>
  Annual Work Plan<br>
  Our Annual Work Plan (Plan) outlines our perspective of the top management challenges 
  facing the Social Security Administration (SSA) and serves as a tool for communicating 
  our priorities to SSA, the Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), 
  and other interested parties. The activities described address the fundamental 
  goals related to SSA's mission to administer Social Security programs and operations 
  effectively and efficiently. Our work is prioritized to focus our resources 
  on those areas that are most vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse. To ensure 
  we provide a coordinated effort, we work closely with the Offices of Investigations, 
  Chief Counsel to the Inspector General, and Executive Operations. <br>
  Our Plan is categorized to mirror the top management challenges that cut across 
  the Government, as outlined in the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and rated 
  by OMB's Scorecard.<br>
  <br>
  The PMA was designed to coordinate agency efforts to &quot;address the most 
  apparent deficiencies and focus resources where the opportunity to improve performance 
  is the greatest.&quot; The PMA's goal is to establish a more responsible and 
  responsive Government that is citizen-centered, results-oriented, and market-based. 
  OMB provides each Federal agency a scorecard rating their performance. The scorecard 
  is designed around a simple grading system: green for success, yellow for mixed 
  results, and red for unsatisfactory. Following is the status of SSA's efforts, 
  as reported by OMB's June 2005 Scorecard.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Plan describes 102 reviews we intend to complete, 73 reviews we intend 
  to begin, and 16 performance indicator reviews we will oversee in FY 2006 in 
  the following issue areas. <br>
  Social Security Number Protection <br>
  Management of the Disability Process <br>
  Improper Payments and Recovery of Overpayments<br>
  Internal Control Environment and Performance Measures<br>
  Systems Security and Critical Infrastructure Protection <br>
  Service Delivery and Electronic Government<br>
  To assist us in this analysis, we crosswalked the PMA, Commissioner Priorities, 
  Social Security Advisory Board, and Government Accountability Office (GAO) high-risk 
  areas to those identified by our prior and ongoing work. The following table 
  demonstrates that our perspective is congruent with other key decisionmakers. 
  <br>
</p>
<p>In preparing this Plan, we solicited suggestions from the Agency. We received 
  a number of suggestions for inclusion in our Plan, and we have incorporated 
  as many of them as possible. <br>
  <br>
  We recognize this Plan is dynamic, so we encourage continuous feedback and additional 
  suggestions. This flexibility enables us to meet emerging and critical issues 
  evolving throughout the upcoming year.<br>
  <br>
  For more information on this Plan, please contact the Office of Audit at (410) 
  965-9700. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2004, SSA issued over 17.8 million original and replacement Social Security 
  number (SSN) cards, and SSA received approximately $545 billion in employment 
  taxes related to earnings under assigned SSNs. Protecting the SSN and properly 
  posting the earnings reported under SSNs are critical to ensure individuals 
  entitled to benefits receive the full benefits due them.<br>
  <br>
  Efforts to Protect the SSN<br>
  The SSN has become a key to social, legal, and financial assimilation in this 
  country. Because the SSN is so heavily relied on as an identifier, it is also 
  valuable as an illegal commodity. Criminals improperly obtain SSNs by (1) presenting 
  false documentation; (2) stealing another person's SSN; (3) purchasing an SSN; 
  (4) using the SSN of a deceased individual; or <br>
  (5) contriving an SSN by selecting any nine digits. <br>
  <br>
  SSA has taken steps to improve controls in its enumeration process. SSA verifies 
  all immigration documents before assigning SSNs to noncitizens. Additionally, 
  SSA requires <br>
  (1) mandatory interviews for all applicants for original SSNs who are age 12 
  or older (lowered from age 18) and (2) evidence of identity for all children, 
  regardless of age. In addition, SSA has established Enumeration Centers in Brooklyn, 
  New York, and Las Vegas, Nevada, that focus exclusively on assigning SSNs and 
  issuing SSN cards. Also, in FY 2005, SSA implemented new systems enhancements 
  that simplified the interpretation of, and compliance with, SSA's complex enumeration 
  policies. Furthermore, the Agency enhanced its Modernized Enumeration System 
  to interrupt the issuance of SSN cards when a parent claims to have an improbably 
  large number of children and add an alert to an individual's record when the 
  SSN has been used to establish a fictitious identity. <br>
  <br>
  In addition to these improvements, SSA is planning to implement several other 
  enhancements that will better ensure SSN protection. These endeavors were required 
  by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The plans include 
  the following:<br>
  Restricting the issuance of multiple replacement SSN cards to 3 per year and 
  10 in a lifetime.<br>
  Requiring independent verification of any birth record submitted by an individual 
  to establish eligibility for an SSN, other than for purposes of enumeration 
  at birth. <br>
  Coordinating with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other agencies 
  to further improve the security of Social Security cards and numbers. <br>
  Working with the Department of Health and Human Services to promulgate standards 
  to increase the integrity and consistency of birth certificates.<br>
  <br>
  We applaud the Agency for these efforts and believe, over the past several years, 
  SSA has made significant strides in providing greater protection for the SSN. 
  Nevertheless, throughout society, incidences of SSN misuse continue to rise. 
  Accordingly, to further protect SSN integrity, we believe SSA should: <br>
  Encourage public and private entities to limit use of the SSN as an individual 
  identifier.<br>
  Continue to address identified weaknesses in its information security environment 
  to better safeguard SSNs.<br>
  Continue to coordinate with partner agencies to pursue any data sharing agreements 
  that would increase data integrity.<br>
  <br>
  The SSN and Reported Earnings<br>
  Properly posting earnings ensures eligible individuals receive the full retirement, 
  survivor and/or disability benefits due them. If earnings information is reported 
  incorrectly or not reported at all, SSA cannot ensure all individuals entitled 
  to benefits are receiving the correct payment amounts. In addition, SSA's programs 
  depend on earnings information to determine whether an individual is eligible 
  for benefits and to calculate the amount of benefit payments.<br>
  <br>
  SSA spends scarce resources correcting earnings data when incorrect information 
  is reported. The Earnings Suspense File (ESF) is the Agency's record of annual 
  wage reports for which wage earners' names and SSNs fail to match SSA's records. 
  As of October 2004, SSA had posted approximately 9 million wage items to its 
  ESF for Tax Year 2002, representing about $56 billion in wages. This was before 
  some planned edits, which may have further reduced this number.<br>
  <br>
  While SSA has limited control over the factors that cause the volume of erroneous 
  wage reports submitted each year, there are still areas where the Agency can 
  improve its processes. SSA can improve wage reporting by educating employers 
  on reporting criteria, identifying and resolving employer reporting problems, 
  and encouraging greater use of the Agency's SSN verification programs. SSA also 
  needs to coordinate with other Federal agencies with separate, yet related, 
  mandates. For example, the Agency now collaborates with the Internal Revenue 
  Service (IRS) to achieve more accurate wage reporting. <br>
  <br>
  SSA has taken steps to reduce the size and growth of the ESF. For example, in 
  June 2005, SSA expanded its voluntary Social Security Number Verification Service 
  (SSNVS) to all interested employers nationwide. SSNVS allows employers to verify 
  the names and SSNs of employees before reporting their wages to SSA. SSA also 
  participates in a joint program with DHS, called the Basic Pilot, which verifies 
  the names and SSNs of employees as well as their citizenship and authorization 
  to work in the U.S. economy. In December 2004, the Basic Pilot program was made 
  available to employers nationwide.<br>
  <br>
  The Agency is also modifying the information it shares with employers. Under 
  the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, SSA is required 
  to add both death and fraud indicators to the SSN verification systems for employers, 
  State agencies issuing drivers' licenses and identity cards, and other verification 
  routines, as determined appropriate by the Commissioner of Social Security.<br>
  <br>
  The SSN and Unauthorized Work<br>
  SSA assigns nonwork SSNs to noncitizens who are (1) in the United States but 
  are not authorized to work and (2) are applying for, or are recipients of, a 
  federally financed benefit that requires an SSN. Recently, SSA strictly limited 
  the assignment of such numbers. Furthermore, SSA tracks earnings reported under 
  a nonwork SSN and reports this information to DHS. Nonetheless, our audits have 
  noted several issues related to nonwork SSNs, including (1) the type of evidence 
  provided to obtain a nonwork SSN, (2) the reliability of nonwork SSN information 
  in SSA's records, (3) the significant volume of wages reported under nonwork 
  SSNs, and (4) the payment of benefits to noncitizens who qualified for their 
  benefits while working in the country without proper authorization. <br>
  <br>
  In March 2004, Congress placed new restrictions on the receipt of SSA benefits 
  by noncitizens who are not authorized to work in the United States. Under the 
  Social Security Protection Act of 2004, if a noncitizen worker was first assigned 
  an SSN on or after January 1, 2004, Title II benefits are precluded based on 
  his/her earnings unless the noncitizen was ever assigned an SSN for work purposes 
  or admitted to the United States as a visitor for business (B-1) or as an allied 
  crewman (D-1/D-2).<br>
  SSA's implementation of this new law will require increased coordination with 
  DHS to ensure SSA has the correct work status information in its records. </p>
<p>In FY 2006, we plan to complete 19 reviews and begin 13 reviews in this area.</p>

  Assessment of the Validity of Earnings Posted to the Social Security Administration's 
  Master Earnings File for Children Ages 7 Through 13 <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether individuals are inappropriately claiming earnings on children's 
  SSNs. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Office of Earnings, Enumeration and Administrative Systems has ESF alerts 
  for multiple/unusual postings for children under age 7. Effective Tax Year 1991, 
  the Annual Wage Reporting process checks the Numerical Identification (Numident) 
  for the reported SSN and date of birth. If the date of birth indicates the numberholder 
  is age 6 or younger, the earnings are identified as a Young Children's Earnings 
  Record item and placed in the ESF. When the Annual Wage Reporting process is 
  complete, a Young Children's Earnings Record investigate file is generated to 
  determine whether the earnings belong to the reported SSN. There is no alert 
  process in place for earnings on the records of children ages 7 through 13.<br>
  <br>
  Basic Pilot Between the Social Security Administration and the Department of 
  Homeland Security<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the controls over data sharing and verification in SSA's joint pilot 
  with DHS to verify employment eligibility.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act of 1996 established 
  the Basic Pilot, a voluntary employee verification program for employers. <br>
  <br>
  The program involves verifying the employment authorization of all newly hired 
  employees against SSA and DHS databases. <br>
  The President signed the Basic Pilot Extension and Expansion Act of 2003 on 
  December 3, 2003. This new law extends the pilot program for 5 more years (11 
  years total) and expands it to all 50 States as of December 2004. <br>
  <br>
  Congressional Response Report: Enumeration of F-1 Students <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether foreign students receiving SSNs based on work authorization 
  letters from schools and documentation of promised or actual employment attend 
  classes and are employed on-campus. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In October 2004, SSA implemented the regulation, Evidence Requirements for Assignment 
  of Social Security Numbers; Assignment of SSNs to Foreign Academic Students 
  in F 1 Status. The regulation requires that F-1 students who do not have a DHS 
  Employment Authorization Document or authorization for curricular practical 
  training must provide an on-campus work authorization and evidence they have 
  secured employment or a promise of employment. <br>
  <br>
  The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs is concerned that some educational 
  institutions are providing students with work authorization letters and documentation 
  of promised employment when they do not intend to hire the students for on-campus 
  employment. Rather, the schools may be providing this documentation solely to 
  assist the students in obtaining SSNs. <br>
  <br>
  Disposal of Sensitive Documents at the Social Security Administration <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether employees are disposing of sensitive documents in accordance 
  with SSA's policy. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  As a part of SSA's financial statement audit, we accompanied PricewaterhouseCoopers' 
  staff during site visits to various SSA facilities nationwide. During several 
  site visits, we observed conditions regarding the disposal of sensitive documents 
  that warranted management's attention. <br>
  <br>
  We have issued memorandums to the Deputy Commissioner for Operations and the 
  Regional Commissioner for Seattle identifying several instances of improper 
  disposal of sensitive documents in various SSA offices. These documents contained 
  SSNs and other identifying information, such as names, addresses, earnings, 
  and bank account numbers. <br>
  <br>
  Effectiveness of the Young Children's Earnings Records Reinstatement Process 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the effectiveness of the Young Children's Earnings Record reinstatement 
  process in resolving suspended wages, reducing the size of the ESF, and detecting 
  potential fraud. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  As part of the annual earnings reporting process, SSA reviews the Numident to 
  determine whether the individual is a minor. If the date of birth indicates 
  the individual is under age 7, the earnings are placed in the ESF and transmitted 
  to a Young Children's Earnings Record investigate file so notices can be printed 
  and mailed to employers and/or employees. These notices request that the addressee 
  confirm or update the employee's information.<br>
  <br>
  The suspended earnings are reinstated if the employer confirms the information 
  SSA received is correct. If the information is incorrect, SSA contacts the employee 
  and instructs him or her to visit an SSA field office (FO) to update his or 
  her information. Unresolved earnings remain in the ESF.<br>
  <br>
  Employers with the Most Wage Items in the Nonwork Alien File<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To (1) identify and profile the 100 employers responsible for sending the most 
  wage items to the Nonwork Alien (NWALIEN) file for Tax Years 2001 through 2003 
  and (2) determine the accuracy of the data in this file.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA assigns SSNs to noncitizens who do not have DHS' permission to work in the 
  United States under very limited circumstances. These reasons include (1) a 
  Federal statute or regulation requiring that a noncitizen provide his or her 
  SSN to get a particular benefit or service to which he or she has otherwise 
  established entitlement or (2) a State or local law requiring that a noncitizen 
  who is legally in the United States provide his or her SSN to get public assistance 
  benefits to which he or she has otherwise established entitlement and for which 
  all other requirements have been met. SSA issues these individuals SSN cards 
  that are annotated with a &quot;not valid for employment&quot; legend. Each 
  year, SSA informs DHS of noncitizens who are potentially working illegally using 
  nonwork SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  Follow-up: Controls over Nonwork Social Security Numbers<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To review SSA's efforts to resolve nonwork SSN issues reported by our earlier 
  audit, which (1) analyzed Social Security benefits being paid to individuals 
  under nonwork SSNs, (2) analyzed earnings reported for nonwork SSNs, and (3) 
  determined whether SSA had adequate controls over the issuance of nonwork SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA regulations regarding the assignment of nonwork SSNs were published in March 
  1974 during the Agency's implementation of the Social Security Amendments of 
  1972. SSA's policies implementing these regulations required that applicants 
  for nonwork SSNs document a valid reason for needing an SSN, but it was not 
  until January 1996 that SSA officially defined what constituted a valid reason. 
  Before this time, SSA issued nonwork SSNs for a variety of reasons including 
  tax, banking, school, insurance, driver's license, and Government benefit purposes. 
  As of August 1997, SSA had issued approximately 7 million nonwork SSNs. Recently, 
  the number of nonwork SSNs issued has declined because SSA has limited the circumstances 
  under which it will issue these numbers. <br>
  <br>
  Based on our prior audit results, we believed there was a need for legislation 
  prohibiting the crediting of SSN accounts with earnings and related quarters 
  of coverage for periods of unauthorized work. The amount of benefit payments 
  resulting from the credits is significant. We estimate that about $63 million 
  in benefits would be paid under the accounts of SSN holders who were age 62 
  and older as of August 7, 1997, for the 12-month period ended May 1999. In addition, 
  we estimated $1.7 billion would have been paid under these accounts by 2019 
  as a result of the credits. We recommended that SSA (1) propose legislation 
  to prohibit the crediting of nonwork earnings and related quarters of coverage 
  for purposes of benefit entitlement; (2) perform its own actuarial calculations 
  of the effects of the nonwork quarters of coverage on benefit payments, if deemed 
  necessary, to support changes in legislation; (3) conduct periodic quality reviews 
  of processed SSN applications and provide timely feedback to field office personnel; 
  and (4) review the 452 unrestricted SSNs processed by the California field offices 
  temporary Service Representatives to identify other coding errors that resulted 
  in the incorrect issuance of SSN cards containing work authorization.<br>
  <br>
  In its response, SSA stated it had long been concerned about the use of nonwork 
  SSNs in the employment sector. However, the Agency believed the issue of unauthorized 
  work could be dealt with more effectively through pilot projects for determining 
  work eligibility than through a legislative proposal. SSA asserted that the 
  legislative proposal we recommended would be difficult to administer because 
  the Agency's records would not allow the determination of when an individual 
  may or may not be allowed to work.<br>
  <br>
  Follow-up: Enumeration at Birth Program<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the status of corrective actions SSA has taken to address recommendations 
  resulting from our September 2001 report, Audit of the Enumeration at Birth 
  Program. We will also determine whether SSA's internal controls adequately protect 
  the integrity of the Enumeration at Birth process.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Implemented in 1990, the Enumeration at Birth program assigns SSNs to newborns, 
  with parental approval, as part of States' birth registration process. In FY 
  2004, SSA assigned about 4 million original SSNs to newborns through Enumeration 
  at Birth. <br>
  Our prior review of the procedures and related controls employed by the hospitals, 
  cognizant Bureaus of Vital Statistics, and SSA disclosed the need for SSA to 
  establish additional controls to reduce the Enumeration at Birth program's vulnerability 
  to error and misuse and to enhance program efficiency. For example, we recommended 
  that SSA enhance its duplicate record detection and prior SSN detection routines 
  to provide greater protection against the assignment of multiple SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  Follow-up: Issues Identified During the Internal Control Review over the Processing 
  of Social Security Number Cards<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether the proposed recommendations from the previous review have 
  been implemented.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In January 2004, we issued a report on the internal controls over the processing 
  of SSN cards at SSA's National Computer Center. This report identified significant 
  internal control weaknesses. We made several recommendations to strengthen the 
  internal control structure. <br>
  <br>
  Hospitals' Use and Protection of Social Security Numbers<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess hospitals' use and protection of SSNs and the potential risks associated 
  with such use.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Millions of individuals seek medical care each year. To assist in this process, 
  many hospitals use individuals' SSNs as unique identifiers. The potential for 
  identity theft increases each time an individual divulges his or her SSN. Recent 
  incidents of identity theft at hospitals have led some hospitals to reconsider 
  the practice of using SSNs as identifiers. However, at many hospitals, individuals 
  continue to be identified primarily by their SSN, even when another identifier 
  would suffice.<br>
  <br>
  Impact of Employer Wage Corrections on the Earnings Suspense File <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the effect of corrected wage postings on the size of the ESF. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Each year, employers send SSA over 230 million Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. 
  Periodically, an employer will report an incorrect amount for an employee and 
  send SSA a corrected W-2.<br>
  <br>
  Earnings reported under a name/SSN that do not match SSA's records go into the 
  ESF. If the suspended wage report is later corrected, the original and corrected 
  W-2s remain in the ESF until they are reinstated to the Master Earnings File. 
  However, if the employer corrects a wage amount but does not correct the name/SSN, 
  the ESF will continue to show original and corrected wages, which could lead 
  to an over/underestimate of the ESF's true size. <br>
  <br>
  Individuals Receiving Benefits Under Multiple Social Security Numbers at Different 
  Addresses<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify improper payments made to Title II and/or Title XVI beneficiaries 
  who are receiving payments under multiple SSNs at different addresses.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In FY 2005, we issued a report on individuals who received benefits under multiple 
  SSNs at the same address. This report identified over $9.1 million in overpayments 
  and $1.4 million in savings. <br>
  <br>
  Our initial computer analysis of Title II and XVI recipient records on the date 
  of birth, first five characters of the individual's first name, mother's maiden 
  name, father's last name, and place of birth resulted in numerous matches where 
  it appears to be the same person with a different SSN and address.<br>
  <br>
  Issuance of Replacement Social Security Number Cards to Prisoners <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the effectiveness of SSA's controls for issuing replacement SSN cards 
  under prison agreements. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Correctional institutions often assist inmates in obtaining a replacement SSN 
  card before their release to facilitate their return to society. In some cases, 
  the only proof of identity the inmates provide is a prison record. At least 
  three cases have been identified in which individuals were incarcerated in a 
  State prison under someone else's identity. In two of those cases, the individuals 
  attempted to obtain replacement SSN cards under aliases and were only caught 
  because the individuals were dead. <br>
  <br>
  Prisoners' Access to Social Security Numbers <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the extent to which prisoners have access to SSNs and how this 
  could increase incidences of identity theft. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  There is no legal prohibition on inmates working in prison industries from having 
  access to customers' SSNs. The Social Security Number Privacy and Identity Theft 
  Prevention Act of 2005 seeks to prohibit government entities from employing 
  inmates in any type of prison industry that would allow prisoners access to 
  the SSNs of other individuals. GAO found that, as of 1998, about 1.2 million 
  inmates had access to personal information through correctional industry work 
  programs. <br>
  <br>
  Self-Employment Income Earnings Suspense File <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify patterns of errors and irregularities in self-employment income 
  (SEI) posted to the ESF. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Section 1401 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that the IRS impose the Self-Employment 
  Contributions Act tax on self-employment earnings. This tax is equivalent to 
  the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax and includes contributions for the 
  Social Security and Medicare programs. IRS shares SEI information with SSA so 
  it can be posted to the appropriate earner's record.<br>
  <br>
  SSA matches this reported SEI with its Numident file to verify an individual's 
  name and SSN to record the earnings in the individual's Master Earnings File. 
  Income reports with invalid name/SSN combinations are placed in the SEI ESF.<br>
  <br>
  Suspended and Nonwork Wages Among the Social Security Administration's Contractors 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether contractors providing goods and services to SSA have employees 
  with (1) SSNs that do not match the name/SSN combination in SSA's records or 
  (2) nonwork SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA does business with thousands of contractors who provide a variety of goods 
  and services including medical, worker rehabilitation, consulting, auditing, 
  and verification services. SSA information and facilities could be exposed to 
  unnecessary risks if these contractors are employing individuals who provided 
  incorrect name/SSN combinations and/or are not authorized to work in the United 
  States.<br>
  <br>
  Suspended and Nonwork Wages in the Social Security Administration's Payroll 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA employees are working under (1) SSNs that do not match 
  the name/SSN in SSA's records or (2) nonwork SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA employees should (1) provide SSA with a correct name/SSN combination so 
  their wages can be properly posted to their earnings record and (2) be authorized 
  to work in the United States. SSA employees who do not meet these criteria could 
  expose SSA's information and facilities to unnecessary risks.<br>
  <br>
  Our September 2003 report, Profile of the Social Security Administration's Non-Work 
  Alien File, stated that individuals who have public responsibilities and positions 
  of trust, including SSA employees, have wages recorded in SSA's unauthorized 
  employment file. <br>
  <br>
  The Impact of Unauthorized Employment on Social Security Benefits <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the impact of unauthorized employment on Social Security benefits 
  and the accuracy of employment authorization information as recorded on SSA's 
  Numident. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Each year, SSA informs the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) 
  about earnings reported on nonwork SSNs. SSA sends the notification in the NWALIEN 
  file. Resource priorities and data compatibility problems have prevented USCIS 
  from effectively using this information. <br>
  <br>
  While SSA notifies USCIS of earnings reported under nonwork SSNs, USCIS does 
  not routinely tell SSA when it changes a person's employment status from unauthorized 
  to authorized. Unless the person informs SSA of such a change, the person's 
  earnings will continue to be reported in the NWALIEN file. Consequently, SSA 
  does not know the number of workers shown on the NWALIEN file who are authorized 
  for employment, or the amount of SSA benefits resulting from unauthorized employment. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Universities' Use of Social Security Numbers as Student Identifiers in Region 
  IX<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess universities' use of SSNs as student identifiers and the potential 
  risks associated with such use.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Millions of students enroll in educational institutions each year. To assist 
  in this process, many colleges and universities use students' SSNs as personal 
  identifiers. The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions 
  Officers found that almost half (1,036) of member institutions that responded 
  to a 2002 survey used SSNs as the primary student identifier.<br>
  The potential for identity theft increases each time an individual divulges 
  his or her SSN. Recent incidents of identity theft at universities have led 
  some schools to reconsider the practice of using SSNs as the primary student 
  identifier. However, at many colleges and universities, students continue to 
  be identified primarily by their SSN, even when another identifier would suffice.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>SSA administers the Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income 
  (SSI) programs, which provide benefits based on disability. Most disability 
  claims are initially processed through a network of Social Security FOs and 
  State Disability Determination Services (DDS). SSA representatives in the FOs 
  are responsible for obtaining applications for disability benefits, disability 
  report forms and authorization for disclosure of information forms as well as 
  verifying non-medical eligibility requirements, which may include age, employment, 
  marital status, or Social Security coverage information. After initial processing, 
  the FO sends the case to a DDS to develop medical evidence and evaluate the 
  disability. <br>
  <br>
  Once SSA establishes an individual is eligible for disability benefits under 
  either the DI or SSI program, the Agency turns its efforts toward ensuring the 
  individual continues to receive benefits only as long as SSA's eligibility criteria 
  are met. For example, a continuing disability review (CDR) may show the individual 
  no longer meets SSA's disability criteria or has demonstrated medical improvement.<br>
  <br>
  If an individual disagrees with the Agency's decision on his or her claim or 
  CDR, the claimant can appeal to SSA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). 
  OHA's field structure consists of 10 regional offices and 140 hearing offices. 
  OHA's administrative law judges (ALJ) hold hearings and issue decisions. In 
  FY 2004, hearing offices processed 497,379 cases. OHA's average processing time 
  has increased significantly from 308 days in FY 2001 to 391 days in FY 2004. 
  Further, the pending workload was 635,601 cases on September 30, 2004, whereas 
  it was 392,387 cases on September 30, 2001. We have focused our attention on 
  weaknesses within OHA-such as the backlog of cases, safeguards for sensitive 
  information in case files, and shredding documents. <br>
  <br>
  GAO added modernizing Federal disability programs-including SSA's-to its 2003 
  high-risk list due, in part, to outmoded concepts of disability, lengthy processing 
  times, and decisional inconsistencies. To address improvements needed in SSA's 
  disability programs, the Commissioner of Social Security presented to Congress, 
  on September 25, 2003, her proposed plan for the disability determination process. 
  On July 26, 2005, the Commissioner announced proposed regulations in the Federal 
  Register, which outlines her plan. The proposed regulations would: <br>
  establish a Quick Disability Determination process through which State agencies 
  will expedite initial determinations for claimants who are clearly disabled; 
  <br>
  create a Federal Expert Unit to augment and strengthen medical and vocational 
  expertise for disability adjudicators at all levels of the disability determination 
  process; <br>
  eliminate the State agency reconsideration step and terminate the disability 
  prototype that SSA is conducting in 10 States; <br>
  establish Federal reviewing officials to review State agency initial determinations 
  upon the claimants' request; <br>
  preserve the claimants' right to request and be provided a de novo hearing, 
  which will be conducted by an ALJ; <br>
  close the record after the ALJ issues a decision, but allow for the consideration 
  of new and material evidence under certain circumstances; <br>
  gradually shift certain Appeals Council functions to a newly established Decision 
  Review Board; and <br>
  strengthen in-line and end-of-line quality review mechanisms at the State agency, 
  reviewing official, hearing, and Decision Review Board levels of the disability 
  determination process. <br>
  <br>
  In addition to the Commissioner's proposed improvements to the disability process, 
  the Agency is transitioning to the electronic disability folder. The electronic 
  disability folder will allow for disability claims information to be stored 
  and transmitted electronically between FOs, DDSs, and OHA. <br>
  <br>
  SSA is working to ensure that individuals with disabilities who want to work 
  have the opportunity to do so. The Comprehensive Work Opportunity Initiative 
  represents the Agency's overarching strategy to assist individuals with disabilities 
  in attaining economic self-sufficiency and breaking through potential barriers 
  to employment. The Ticket to Work program, which provides beneficiaries with 
  disabilities expanded options for access to employment, vocational rehabilitation, 
  and other support services to help them work, is one element of SSA's Comprehensive 
  Work Opportunity Initiative.<br>
  <br>
  Disability Fraud<br>
  Fraud is an inherent risk in SSA's disability programs. Some unscrupulous people 
  view SSA's disability benefits as money waiting to be taken. A key risk factor 
  in the disability program is individuals who feign or exaggerate symptoms to 
  become eligible for disability benefits. Another key risk factor is the monitoring 
  of medical improvements for disabled individuals to ensure those individuals 
  who are no longer disabled are removed from the disability rolls. <br>
  <br>
  We are working with SSA to address the integrity of the disability programs 
  through the Cooperative Disability Investigation (CDI) program. The CDI program's 
  mission is to obtain evidence that can resolve questions of fraud in SSA's disability 
  programs. The CDI program is managed in a cooperative effort between SSA's Office 
  of Operations, the OIG, and the Office of Disability Programs. There are 19 
  CDI units operating in 17 States. During FY 2004, the CDI units saved SSA almost 
  $133 million by identifying fraud and abuse related to initial and continuing 
  claims in the disability program. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2006, we plan to complete 13 reviews and begin 7 reviews in this area.</p>

<p>Assessing the Application Controls for the Social Security Administration's 
  Integrated Disability Management System <br>
</p>
<p>Objective<br>
  To assess the application controls for SSA's Integrated Disability Management 
  System. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Integrated Disability Management System was established as the central repository 
  for disability information for all Title II and XVI beneficiaries to enhance 
  management of post-entitlement disability-related actions and determinations. 
  The Integrated Disability Management System houses most of the disability-related 
  data that were previously contained in SSA's Master Beneficiary Record, including 
  claims information by individual SSN. <br>
  <br>
  The Integrated Disability Management System integrates several disability-related 
  systems and databases, including the Disability Control File, Ticket Payment 
  File, Earnings File, and Employment Network payment system. The integration 
  of these systems and databases helps SSA monitor all disability-related information 
  for a beneficiary, including work and earnings, Ticket to Work status, pending 
  and processed CDRs, and expedited reinstatement actions. The Integrated Disability 
  Management System processes Employment Network payments and helps ensure SSA 
  periodically reviews the medical condition of all individuals receiving disability 
  benefits to determine whether beneficiaries and recipients continue to be disabled. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Case Management Procedures at the Hearing Office in Creve Coeur, Missouri <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether evidence exists to substantiate allegations related to 
  inefficient case management procedures at the Creve Coeur Hearing Office.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  OHA is responsible for holding hearings and issuing decisions as part of SSA's 
  process for determining whether a person may receive benefits. OHA directs a 
  nation-wide field organization staffed with more than 1,150 ALJs who conduct 
  impartial &quot;de novo&quot; hearings and make decisions on appealed determinations 
  involving SSA's retirement, survivors, disability, and supplemental security 
  income programs.<br>
  <br>
  We received an allegation related to the Creve Coeur Hearing Office's case management 
  procedures. Specifically, it was alleged that (1) the hearing office delays 
  the issuance of decisions once its monthly quota has been met and (2) ALJs process 
  an inequitable number of cases, which has resulted in a backlog of thousands 
  of cases. <br>
  <br>
  To address the allegations, we will interview staff at the Creve Coeur Hearing 
  Office and analyze OHA case processing statistics. If our analysis of these 
  statistics discloses that these alleged practices are occurring at other hearing 
  offices, we will extend our work to hearing offices nationwide.<br>
  <br>
  Case Processing and Management System and Workload Management <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the Case Processing and Management System's (CPMS) ability to improve 
  workload management at hearing offices in OHA. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA designed and developed CPMS to enhance and improve the efficiency of its 
  hearings case management system in its hearing offices. CPMS is one part of 
  SSA's Electronic Disability initiative. <br>
  <br>
  OHA completed its installation of CPMS in 2004. CPMS replaces the Hearing Office 
  Tracking System for all cases, with the exception of cases pertaining to Medicare 
  claims. CPMS implementation began in pilot sites in December 2003, and, by August 
  2004, it was operational in all 140 hearing offices.<br>
  <br>
  CPMS contains significant enhancements for OHA, including improved development 
  tools, case controls, notice tools, and management information. In addition, 
  CPMS will provide extensive data propagation, new automated scheduling techniques, 
  an automated knowledge base, interactive screens, a secure and centralized repository 
  of data, hyperlinks to reference material and interfaces with other SSA systems, 
  including the electronic folder. It will also eliminate a number of manual processes. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Controls over Payments to Attorneys <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA has adequate controls over fees paid to attorneys.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  OHA holds hearings as part of SSA's process for determining whether a person 
  is eligible for benefits. The first step in the appeals process is called reconsideration. 
  If the claimant disagrees with that decision, the claimant may request a hearing 
  before an ALJ. The claimant may appoint either an attorney or other qualified 
  individual to represent him or her at the hearing. Claimant representatives 
  charge and receive a fee for their services. <br>
  <br>
  Attorney fee payments are processed at program service centers using the Single 
  Payment System. The Single Payment System replaced the manual One Check Only 
  payment system in May 2002. The Single Payment System is a national system used 
  to automate attorney fee payments and other Title II payments that cannot be 
  made through the Title II system. It was created to ensure timeliness of attorney 
  fee payments, stop duplicate and erroneous payments, reduce the number of inputs, 
  and document management information.<br>
  <br>
  Our August 2001 report, Approval of Claimant Representatives and Fees Paid to 
  Attorneys, stated that SSA made duplicate payments to attorneys, staff did not 
  follow procedures, and attorney fee payments with invalid or incorrect SSNs 
  were not detected. Also, the One Check Only Payment System was used to process 
  payments to attorneys. We made several recommendations, and SSA agreed with 
  most of them. For those recommendations with which SSA disagreed, SSA stated 
  that the Single Payment System should resolve these issues.<br>
  <br>
  Demonstration Project: Qualifications for Non-Attorney Representatives <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the implementation of SSA's demonstration project. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In March 2004, Congress enacted the Social Security Protection Act. Under section 
  303 of the Social Security Protection Act, the Commissioner of Social Security 
  is required to develop and implement a 5-year, nation-wide demonstration project 
  that gives certain non-attorney representatives the option of having approved 
  representatives' fees withheld and paid directly from the beneficiary's past 
  due benefits. Non-attorney representatives who participate in the demonstration 
  project must: hold a bachelor's degree, pass a written examination, secure professional 
  liability insurance, undergo a criminal background check, and complete continuing 
  education courses. OHA is required to report to Congress within 1 year on the 
  demonstration project. <br>
  <br>
  Digital Recording Acquisition Project at the Office of Hearings and Appeals 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the implementation of digital recording equipment in OHA. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In FY 2003, as part of SSA's electronic disability initiative, the Agency started 
  the Digital Recording Acquisition Project. The Digital Recording Acquisition 
  Project's mission entails replacing all of OHA's aging analog, four-track tape 
  recorders with digital equipment to provide an electronic recording that is 
  compatible with the electronic disability initiative.<br>
  Digital recording equipment, and the associated recordable compact discs, are 
  less bulky than the analog equipment and audiocassettes and therefore take less 
  storage space in both the claims folder and SSA's Payment Centers and the Federal 
  Records center. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2004, SSA entered into a contract for the installation and maintenance 
  of digital recording equipment. The contractor is to install and fully integrate 
  1,470 systems at OHA's hearing offices, regions and remote sites. SSA anticipates 
  all hearings will be digitally recorded by February 2006. <br>
  <br>
  Disability Determinations Made for Beneficiaries Convicted of Disability Insurance 
  Fraud<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To examine the sufficiency of disability determinations made for DI beneficiaries 
  subsequently convicted of DI fraud. Specifically, we will identify trends related 
  to fraud cases identified by the Office of Investigations. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The State DDSs are responsible for determining whether individuals who applied 
  for disability benefits are disabled. When the DDS determines the individual 
  is not disabled, the decision can be appealed to OHA, which can, and often does, 
  rule in favor of the applicant with a finding that the individual was disabled. 
  All approved disability claims are then subject to CDRs. If a beneficiary's 
  condition has substantially improved, the individual may be found to be no longer 
  disabled and disability payments are stopped. We received a complaint alleging 
  that DDSs are hard pressed to document substantial improvement when they initially 
  found the individual was not disabled but OHA later ruled in favor of the individual. 
  Consequently, without a determination of substantial improvement in cases where 
  the disabling condition was originally questionable, the individual is not likely 
  to have benefits stopped as a result of the CDR process. <br>
  <br>
  Impact of Statutory Benefit Continuation on Disability Insurance and Supplemental 
  Security Income Benefit Payments Made During the Appeals Process (2 Reports)<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate the financial impact of DI and SSI benefit payments made during 
  the SSA appeals process on the trust fund and the effectiveness of the Public 
  Law allowing benefits to continue. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  A determination of benefit cessation is made when a CDR reveals the beneficiary 
  no longer meets the requirements for disability benefits. Benefit cessation 
  decisions are made by disability examiners in the Office of Central Operations 
  and the DDSs, as well as by disability specialists in the program service centers. 
  Public Law 97-455, as extended by Public Law 101-508, provides the disabled 
  beneficiary the option for DI benefit continuation through the reconsideration 
  and/or ALJ hearing process in medical cessation determinations. Public Law 98-460 
  provides the same payment continuation option to SSI recipients.<br>
  The average OHA processing time for hearings is approximately 370 days for the 
  DI program and 420 days for the SSI program. Benefit payments made during the 
  OHA appeals process are considered overpayments if the cessation decision is 
  upheld. SSA waives the overpayment when the claimant is found to be without 
  fault in causing the overpayment, and recovery or adjustment would defeat the 
  purpose of the disability program. <br>
  <br>
  Office of Hearings and Appeals Reversal of Disability Denial Decisions Involving 
  Investigative Information from Cooperative Disability Investigation Units <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify the circumstances that may have resulted in the allowance of benefits 
  at the hearings level when a prior investigation conducted by a CDI unit contributed 
  to a denial decision. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  CDI units support SSA's strategic goal of establishing zero tolerance for fraud, 
  thus ensuring public confidence in the integrity of SSA's programs and operations. 
  The CDI unit reports facts uncovered during an investigation to resolve questions 
  of fraud in SSA's disability programs. The CDI unit does not make disability 
  determinations; it provides information to the DDSs for their use in making 
  timely and accurate disability determinations. SSA provides most of the funding 
  for the CDI program, while the OIG maintains the day-to-day operations. Together, 
  these agencies have dedicated over 100 full-time staff to the initiative. <br>
  During the period July 1999 through April 2004, CDI investigative results were 
  used to support over 4,700 DDS decisions to deny SSA disability benefits. This 
  allowed SSA to avoid improper payments of approximately $278 million. However, 
  <br>
  906 decisions were appealed to OHA, of which, 526 were overturned. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Independence Day Assessment <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether Independence Day Assessment procedures are effective for 
  deciding when DDSs are ready to implement the electronic folder system. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  To certify that a DDS can operate in a paperless environment, SSA created the 
  Independence Day Assessment. SSA's four-step process is to (1) conduct assessment 
  visits to identify impediments to moving to a fully electronic environment; 
  (2) provide necessary instructions and training for SSA and DDS employees; (3) 
  certify that National Archives and Records Administration recordkeeping requirements 
  are met; and (4) conduct validation visits to certify the DDS is ready to transition 
  to a fully electronic environment.<br>
  <br>
  Before a DDS can be certified to operate in a fully electronic environment, 
  all &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;adjudicatively significant&quot; discrepancies 
  must be resolved. A &quot;critical&quot; or an &quot;adjudicatively significant&quot; 
  discrepancy is an error that can alter the outcome of the disability determination. 
  After certification of the DDS, the appropriate Regional Commissioner will work 
  with the DDS administrator and appropriate SSA officials to decide when the 
  DDS can discard paper source documents. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Ticket to Work Program-Employment Networks 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To conduct a performance review of SSA and its contractor MAXIMUS, Inc., to 
  ensure contract objectives are being met and are in accordance with the Ticket 
  to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Act of 1999 was enacted to enable eligible 
  Social Security and SSI recipients with disabilities to receive a ticket they 
  can use to obtain employment services, vocational rehabilitation services, or 
  other support services from an approved provider of their choice, called an 
  Employment Network. The Employment Network can be a private organization or 
  public agency that agrees to work with SSA to provide Vocational Rehabilitation, 
  employment, and other support services to assist beneficiaries in going to work 
  and remaining on the job. The Employment Network designs a signed agreement 
  to help the disabled beneficiary return to work. As of July 25, 2005, SSA had 
  enrolled 1,347 Employment Networks and 79 Vocational Rehabilitation Agencies. 
  To date, SSA has issued over 10 million tickets. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Ticket to Work Program-Ticket Assignments<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether vocational rehabilitation agencies completed Agency Ticket 
  Assignment Forms (Form SSA-1365) in accordance with the Ticket to Work and Work 
  Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 and related SSA policies.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Advocates of disabled individuals have charged that State vocational rehabilitation 
  agencies have taken advantage of the Ticket to Work program at the expense of 
  the ticket holders. They charge that State vocational rehabilitation agencies 
  are sending the Ticket to Work program manager Forms SSA-1365, State Agency 
  Ticket Assignment Form - Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program, that are 
  unsigned by the disabled beneficiary. The State vocational rehabilitation agencies 
  attach an Individual Plan for Employment to the Form. The Individual Plans for 
  Employment were developed by the State vocational rehabilitation agencies and 
  the disabled beneficiaries. By doing this, State vocational rehabilitation agencies 
  have been able to assign tickets without the ticket holders' knowledge.<br>
  <br>
  As of May 20, 2004, 44,850 tickets have been assigned to State vocational rehabilitation 
  agencies and 4,522 had been assigned to Employment Networks.</p>
<p>Improper payments are defined as any payment that should not have been made 
  or that was in an incorrect amount. Examples of improper payments include inadvertent 
  errors, payments for unsupported or inadequately supported claims, or payments 
  to ineligible beneficiaries. Furthermore, the risk of improper payments increases 
  in programs with a significant volume of transactions, complex criteria for 
  computing payments, and an overemphasis on expediting payments. <br>
  <br>
  SSA and the OIG have discussed such issues as detected versus undetected improper 
  payments and avoidable versus unavoidable overpayments that are outside the 
  Agency's control and a cost of doing business. OMB issued specific guidance 
  to SSA to only include avoidable overpayments in its improper payment estimate 
  because those payments can be reduced through changes in administrative actions. 
  Unavoidable overpayments that result from legal or policy requirements are not 
  to be included in SSA's improper payment estimate.<br>
  <br>
  The President and Congress have expressed interest in measuring the universe 
  of improper payments in the Government. In August 2001, OMB published the PMA, 
  which included a Government-wide initiative for improving financial performance, 
  including reducing improper payments. In November 2002, the Improper Payments 
  Information Act of 2002 was enacted, and OMB issued guidance in May 2003 on 
  implementing this law. Under the Social Security Act, SSA must estimate its 
  annual amount of improper payments and report this information in the Agency's 
  annual Performance and Accountability Report. OMB will then work with SSA to 
  establish goals for reducing improper payments in its programs. <br>
  <br>
  SSA issues billions of dollars in benefit payments under the Old-Age, Survivors 
  and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and SSI programs-and some improper payments 
  are unavoidable. In FY 2004, SSA issued about $522 billion in benefit payments 
  to about 52 million people. Since SSA is responsible for issuing timely benefit 
  payments for complex entitlement programs to millions of people, even the slightest 
  error in the overall process can result in millions of dollars in over- or underpayments. 
  In FY 2005 (through June), SSA reported that it detected over $3 billion in 
  overpayments. SSA also noted in its Performance and Accountability report for 
  FY 2004 that the Agency recovered almost $2 billion in overpayments. <br>
  <br>
  In January 2005, OMB issued a report Improving the Accuracy and Integrity of 
  Federal Payments that noted that seven Federal programs-including SSA's OASDI 
  and SSI programs-accounted for approximately 95 percent of the improper payments 
  in FY 2004. However, this report also noted that SSA had reduced the amount 
  of SSI improper payments by over<br>
  $100 million since levels reported in FY 2003.<br>
  <br>
  SSA has been working to improve its ability to prevent over- and underpayments 
  by obtaining beneficiary information from independent sources sooner and using 
  technology more effectively. For example, the Agency is continuing its efforts 
  to prevent improper payments after a beneficiary dies through the use of Electronic 
  Death Registration information. Also, the Agency's CDR process is in place to 
  identify and prevent beneficiaries who are no longer disabled from receiving 
  payments. Additionally, in FY 2005, SSA implemented eWork-a new automated system 
  to control and process work related CDRs-which should strengthen SSA's ability 
  to identify and prevent improper payments to disabled beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  SSA is also taking action to prevent and recover improper payments. <br>
  <br>
  Working with us in FY 2005 on an OIG audit of Individuals Receiving Benefits 
  Under Multiple Social Security Numbers at the Same Address, SSA identified about 
  $9.2 million in overpayments. <br>
  <br>
  In another FY 2005 review-School Attendance by Student Beneficiaries over Age 
  18-we estimated that SSA disbursed about $70 million in incorrect payments to 
  32,839 students. SSA agreed with our recommendation to ensure the overpayments 
  are established and collection activities initiated for the incorrect payments 
  identified in this audit. <br>
  <br>
  We have helped the Agency reduce improper payments to prisoners and improper 
  SSI payments to fugitive felons. However, our work has shown that improper payments-such 
  as those related to workers' compensation (WC)-continue to occur. Additionally, 
  with the passage of the Social Security Protection Act of 2004, SSA has new 
  opportunities and faces new challenges in preventing and recovering improper 
  payments-such as OASDI benefits to fugitives. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2006, we plan to complete 20 reviews and begin 18 reviews in this area.</p>

  <br>
  Controls over Miscellaneous Payments Made Using the Social Security Administration's 
  Single Payment System<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA has established adequate controls to ensure miscellaneous 
  payments made through the Single Payment System are valid.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA uses the Single Payment System to issue payments for attorney fees and OASDI 
  payments that cannot be made through the current Title II system. The Single 
  Payment System was created to ensure the timeliness of payments, stop duplicate 
  and erroneous payments and document management information. <br>
  <br>
  The Single Payment System is used to make miscellaneous payments: <br>
  when payments due for a prior period (such as prior year earnings) and the continuing 
  status of the case is deferred,<br>
  when the computed net amount due exceeds $29,999.99,<br>
  to pay a death underpayment to a nonbeneficiary,<br>
  to issue an excess refund to a nonbeneficiary or financial institution,<br>
  to pay a limited payability check replacement to a terminated beneficiary and 
  to nonbeneficiaries.<br>
  <br>
  Controls over Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Replacement Checks<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine (1) whether SSA FO and teleservice center employees are following 
  procedures for nonreceipt of OASDI payments; (2) the effectiveness of controls 
  over the number of double-check negotiations issued to the same beneficiary 
  or payee; and (3) the effectiveness of actions to recover double-check negotiations.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  When SSA receives a report of nonreceipt of a benefit check, the interviewer 
  reviews the Master Beneficiary Record, the Payment History Update System, the 
  Supplemental Security Record, or Inquiry Response queries to determine whether 
  the nonreceipt report is appropriate. If appropriate, and the required delivery 
  time has elapsed, the nonreceipt report is transmitted with a B- or C-stop, 
  as appropriate, via direct input to the central office.<br>
  <br>
  In certain situations, a replacement check should not be issued to a beneficiary 
  until SSA receives a reply from Treasury on the status of the original check 
  if the MBR contains a special message alerting that the claimant has previously 
  misused the non-receipt reporting process. SSA staff can annotate the Master 
  Beneficiary Record with a special message if a claimant negotiated both an original 
  and a replacement check within the 2 years immediately preceding a claim of 
  non-receipt.<br>
  <br>
  Controls over Payments to Auxiliary Beneficiaries Enumerated After the Primary's 
  Death <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether controls over payments to auxiliary beneficiaries enumerated 
  after a wage earner's death were effective. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Children, widows, spouses, and parents who receive Social Security benefits 
  based on a primary wage earner's Social Security record are referred to as auxiliary 
  beneficiaries. Each auxiliary beneficiary must have an assigned SSN to receive 
  benefits. If an auxiliary or survivor claimant does not have an SSN, an Application 
  for a Social Security Card (Form SS-5) must be completed. <br>
  <br>
  The primary wage earner's SSN is used to track the auxiliary beneficiary's benefit 
  payments. SSA commonly refers to the auxiliary beneficiary's SSN as the Beneficiary's 
  Own Account Number and maintains this information on the Master Beneficiary 
  Record. <br>
  <br>
  In the Dallas Region, the Office of Investigations found an SSA employee was 
  committing fraud by enumerating nonexistent children for deceased wage earners. 
  The &quot;false&quot; children applied for survivor's benefits, and the benefits 
  were deposited into bank accounts that were accessible by the SSA employee. 
  The fraudulently obtained funds were then used at the employee's discretion. 
  In all these cases, the fictitious children were enumerated after the primary's 
  date of death. <br>
  <br>
  Controls over Survivor's Benefits When Indications Exist a Wage Earner is Alive 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the appropriateness of continued survivor's benefits when SSA records 
  indicate the wage earner is alive. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA accepts and posts death reports for nonbeneficiaries received from a relative, 
  friend, neighbor, or others. The reporter must provide the name, date of birth, 
  and SSN before SSA can add the death to the Numident. These reports can be made 
  by mail, telephone, or in person. Although SSA may accept death reports for 
  nonbeneficiaries from third parties, proof of death is required when a claimant 
  applies for benefits based on the earnings of a deceased person or when a claimant's 
  eligibility is dependent on another person's death. If the death report is posted 
  in error, SSA deletes the death data from its Numident. <br>
  During our audit of Social Security Number Cards Issued After Death, we found 
  survivor's benefits paid without proof of death. We also identified 15 cases 
  in which the primary account holder personally applied for a replacement card 
  while survivor's payments were being made to the numberholder's auxiliary beneficiaries. 
  During our review of the SSN application, we determined that SSA verified the 
  individuals' identities to issue the SSN cards. Even after the individuals' 
  identities were verified, the survivor's benefits continued. <br>
  <br>
  Controls over the Social Security Administration's Death Resurrection Process 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA's procedures and internal controls for its Death Resurrection 
  Process. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  On March 18, 2003, SSA changed the death resurrection process; however, it appears 
  that vulnerabilities remain under the new procedures. Unless the death input 
  is an obvious administrative error, a face-to-face interview is required with 
  the individual. Proof of identity is documented electronically and annotated 
  to show the names of two SSA employees: an initiator and an approver. The approver 
  then takes action to resume benefit payments. If the reinstatement action results 
  in an exception, the matter is referred to the Payment Service Center for resumption 
  of benefits. <br>
  <br>
  Cross-Program Recovery of Benefit Overpayments<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To review the Agency's actions pertaining to cross-program recovery of benefit 
  overpayments as authorized by the Social Security Protection Act of 2004. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Social Security Protection Act of 2004, section 210, authorizes SSA to recover 
  overpayments paid under one program from the benefit payments of another program. 
  The provision allows the Agency to withhold up to 100 percent of any underpayment 
  and 10 percent of ongoing monthly benefit payments. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Federal Employees' Compensation Act-Nation-wide Review of Federal Employees 
  with Wages on the Master Earnings File<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether Federal employees are receiving Federal Employees' Compensation 
  Act (FECA) payments for periods in which wages were reported on SSA's Master 
  Earnings File.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  FECA provides income and medical cost protection to covered Federal civilian 
  employees injured on the job, employees who have incurred a work-related injury 
  or occupational disease and beneficiaries of employees whose death is attributable 
  to a job-related injury or occupational disease. It provides payment as compensation 
  for lost wages, monetary awards for bodily impairment or disfigurement, medical 
  care, vocational rehabilitation, and survivor's compensation. <br>
  <br>
  FECA is administered by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Department 
  of Labor. Benefits are paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund, which is 
  principally funded by the Federal agency that employs the injured worker. <br>
  <br>
  Follow-up: Controls over Supplemental Security Income Replacement Checks<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA has addressed the recommendations made in our prior 
  audit, Controls over Supplemental Security Income Replacement Checks. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA generally issues an immediate replacement for missing checks. If SSA has 
  reason to believe an individual is misusing policy of immediate replacement, 
  it can request that Treasury determine the status of the original check before 
  issuing a replacement payment. In addition, if an individual is unsure whether 
  a benefit check was received, SSA will direct Treasury to determine the status 
  of the original check before issuing a replacement.<br>
  <br>
  Improper Benefits Paid to Dually Entitled Title II Beneficiaries <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA's controls to prevent improper payments to dually entitled Title 
  II beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Individuals may be entitled to Title II benefits based on several workers' earnings 
  simultaneously (for example, the earnings of both parents) but may generally 
  only be paid on the higher benefit. When a beneficiary becomes entitled to another, 
  higher benefit, SSA stops issuing the lower benefit payments, thus preventing 
  an overpayment. <br>
  In March 2005, an SSA employee alerted us to a group of cases where it appeared 
  dually entitled Title II beneficiaries were being overpaid. Based on our analysis 
  and discussions with SSA program staff, SSA's controls over dual-entitlement 
  cases could be strengthened. <br>
  <br>
  Improperly Paid Lump Sum Death Payments<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA is incurring losses due to Lump Sum Death Payments 
  erroneously paid when an outstanding overpayment remains on the numberholder's 
  record.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  A lump-sum death benefit of $255 may be paid upon the death of a person who 
  has enough quarters of coverage. This payment is limited to a spouse or a minor 
  child who, in the month of death, is eligible for certain Social Security benefits 
  based on the worker's record. If no spouse or child meeting these requirements 
  exists, the Lump Sum Death Payment is not paid.<br>
  SSA policy states that, when there is a recoverable overpayment to any person 
  on a record, the Lump Sum Death Payment must be withheld. However, Lump Sum 
  Death Payments are routinely paid through SSA FOs via the Modernized Claims 
  System. FOs are responsible for recognizing that an overpayment exists on the 
  record and sending the case to be manually processed in an SSA program service 
  center. If the FO does not recognize the overpayment on the record, the Modernized 
  Claims System will erroneously pay the Lump Sum Death Payment rather than reduce 
  the overpayment. <br>
  <br>
  Match of Veteran's Affairs Historical Death File Against Social Security Administration 
  Payment Files <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA has identified all beneficiaries reported by Veteran's 
  Affairs (VA) as deceased. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In a 2001 audit, we found that SSA had not been matching death records received 
  from VA for at least 2 years. SSA began matching these records again after our 
  audit, but this would only ensure future deaths are identified. To identify 
  all deaths, SSA needs to obtain a historical death file from VA to match against 
  SSA program data. Follow-up with SSA in 2003 found the Agency had not pursued 
  this issue. <br>
  <br>
  We obtained a death file from VA and matched it against Title II and XVI payment 
  records. We identified 1,691 records with a date of death on VA's file but that 
  were in current pay status on SSA's records as of June 2005. <br>
  <br>
  Nursing Home Residents Receiving Supplemental Security Income <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA is obtaining nursing home residential data timely and 
  effectively processing the data to avoid overpayments. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSI payments are available under Title XVI of the Social Security Act to people 
  who are aged, blind, or disabled and have limited resources. Residence in a 
  nursing home or other long-term care facility may affect an SSI recipient's 
  eligibility and/or payment amount.<br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Domestic Employment Reform Act of 1994 requires that nursing 
  homes and other long-term care administrators report the admission of any SSI 
  recipient to SSA within 2 weeks of admission. SSA requires that FO liaisons 
  work closely with the administrators and staff of these institutions to facilitate 
  the flow of information regarding SSA recipients. Further, SSA conducts a monthly 
  match of records maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
  to identify recipients whose admission to a nursing home has not been reported. 
  This match produces diary alerts that are sent to field offices for further 
  processing and verification.<br>
  <br>
  SSA attempts to prevent overpayments to nursing home residents by relying on 
  recipient self-reporting and maintaining contact with nursing homes to obtain 
  admissions information. When SSA does not receive timely notification of an 
  SSI recipient's admission, it may continue to issue benefit payments for months, 
  or even years, after the month of admission.<br>
  <br>
  Overstated Earnings and Their Effect on Social Security Administration Programs 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether Title II and XVI recipients are overstating SEI on their 
  Federal income tax returns and, if so, the effect on SSA programs. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA regional offices have reported that disabled Title II and XVI recipients 
  are overstating SEI on their Federal income tax returns. The overstated SEI 
  makes the individuals eligible for the Federal Earned Income Tax Credit and 
  potentially <br>
  (1) increases their monthly Title II benefits and (2) allows them to acquire 
  quarters of coverage for Title II and Medicare benefits.<br>
  <br>
  We have reviewed a number of cases where individuals receiving Title II and/or 
  XVI disability benefits reported SEI for Tax Years 2000 to 2003 on their Federal 
  income tax returns. When questioned by SSA, the individuals disclaimed the earnings 
  and stated their tax preparer instructed them to report the earnings to become 
  eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. SSA removed the SEI from individual 
  earnings records in most of these cases and was still investigating the other 
  cases. <br>
  We plan to review SSA records to determine whether other SSA regions have experienced 
  these problems, what efforts have been taken to remove these earnings, what 
  information has been shared with the IRS, and whether the overstated earnings 
  have led to improper payments.<br>
  <br>
  Payment Accuracy of Disability Insurance Benefits with a Workers' Compensation 
  Offset <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the accuracy of DI payments with a WC offset that began between 
  January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2004. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA acknowledged the complexity of administering the WC offset provision related 
  to DI claims and that these claims have a relatively high rate of payment errors. 
  As a result, SSA <br>
  1. Conducted a nation-wide WC refresher training course. <br>
  2. Revised the WC chapter in the Program Operations Manual System. <br>
  3. Implemented a revised process to <br>
  re-verify WC information every 3 years. <br>
  4. Released a Title II software redesign to improve payment accuracy by automating 
  computations. <br>
  <br>
  Payments Resulting from Disability Insurance Actions Processed via the Social 
  Security Administration's Manual Adjustment, Credit and Award Processes <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the accuracy of DI payments resulting from actions completed through 
  the Manual Adjustment, Credit and Award Processes (MADCAP). <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA administers the OASDI program under Title II of the Social Security Act. 
  MADCAP is a system used to manually establish, change or correct information 
  maintained on a Title II claimant's Master Beneficiary Record. When SSA's direct 
  input systems cannot automatically process certain actions, SSA's program service 
  center staff manually processes the actions. Certain manual actions can result 
  in MADCAP payments. Between July 1, 2004 and September 30, 2004, SSA made over 
  $773.8 million in MADCAP payments, of which $578.4 million (74.7 percent) was 
  to DI beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  Payments to Surviving Spouses at Retirement Age <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether surviving spouses are receiving the highest benefit due 
  them at retirement age and SSA properly identified and notified eligible survivors 
  about those higher benefits. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title II of the Social Security Act provides retirement and disability benefits 
  to surviving spouses who are over age 60 based on their deceased spouse's earnings. 
  The Act also provides reduced retirement benefits to individuals with sufficient 
  earnings who are age 62 or older. <br>
  <br>
  When a surviving spouse under age 62 applies for Title II benefits, the spouse 
  is limited to survivor benefits because they are not eligible for retirement 
  benefits. If the spouses are age 62 but under full retirement age, they may 
  be eligible to receive reduced retirement benefits based on their own earnings. 
  Surviving spouses who elect not to receive reduced retirement benefits must 
  reapply to obtain retirement benefits, when they reach full retirement age. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Collection of Court-ordered Restitutions<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the effectiveness of SSA's efforts to collect court-ordered restitutions.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Department of Justice (DoJ) has responsibility for collecting payment of 
  Federal debts through its Financial Litigation Unit. The Financial Litigation 
  Unit enforces collection of civil debts on behalf of Federal agencies in litigation 
  that most often involves Federal loan programs, civil penalties assessed by 
  Federal agencies, and civil fraud actions litigated by the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
  DoJ may impose collection efforts, such as property liens and garnishment of 
  wages. DoJ does not, however, discourage the Agency's collection efforts.<br>
  <br>
  SSA's Program Operations Manual System contains procedures for the collection 
  of court-ordered restitutions. It specifically states that regular adjustment 
  and recovery policies apply and cites the actions staff must take to ensure 
  recovery of court-ordered restitutions.<br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Controls over the Old-Age, Survivors and 
  Disability Insurance Waiver Approval Process<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine (1) whether SSA's waiver approval process for administrative waivers 
  of $500 or less safeguard program integrity for the OASDI program and (2) if 
  waiver decisions exceeding $500 are in accordance with Title II of the Social 
  Security Act.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The OASDI program provides protection against the loss of earnings due to retirement, 
  disability or death. <br>
  Payments in an amount greater than the amount to which an individual is entitled 
  are considered overpayments. When an overpayment occurs, it is SSA's responsibility 
  to identify the overpayment and pursue recovery of the debt. Beneficiaries can 
  seek relief from repaying an overpayment by requesting a waiver. Generally, 
  SSA policy allows field office personnel to waive recovery of an overpayment 
  if the beneficiary is without fault and recovery would &quot;defeat the purpose 
  of Title II&quot; or is &quot;against equity and good conscience.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Controls over the Write-off of Uncollectible 
  Title XVI Overpayments<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA properly classified Title XVI overpayments as uncollectible.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  To determine whether an individual qualifies for SSI payments, SSA relies on 
  beneficiary self-disclosure of their financial position and computer matching 
  of financial data from other Federal and State agencies. SSI recipients' income 
  and living expenses may vary over time. If this financial information is not 
  reported to SSA promptly, SSI payments could be made in error and may result 
  in overpayments. In certain situations, SSA determines the overpayment is uncollectible 
  and elects to write the debt off. Generally, SSA writes off uncollectible overpayments 
  when the debt is discharged in a Bankruptcy Court decision,<br>
  an ALJ declared the overpayment uncollectible, the overpaid beneficiary is dead 
  and all proper efforts to collect the overpayment have proved fruitless, there 
  was an early delivery of an SSI check in the month of the recipient's death, 
  <br>
  SSA's system erroneously computed an overpayment, and presumptive disability 
  payments were paid in an earlier month when a later date of onset was established. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2004, SSA wrote off about $84 million in overpayments designated with 
  an &quot;N&quot; Transaction code and a &quot;blank&quot; Recovery Transaction 
  Code. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Decisions to Terminate Collection Efforts 
  for Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Overpayments <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA's decisions to terminate collection efforts for OASDI 
  overpayments were in accordance with its policies and procedures. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA may decide to terminate collection efforts after all collection tools have 
  been used and an overpayment is considered uncollectible. Although collection 
  efforts cease, the overpayments are maintained on SSA's Recovery of Overpayments 
  Accounting and Reporting System as inactive debts that may be recovered in the 
  future. Our August 2004 data extract from SSA's Recovery of Overpayments Accounting 
  and Reporting System identified 64,753 decisions to terminate collection efforts 
  for overpayments totaling approximately $312.8 million in FY 2003.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Internal control comprises the plans, methods, and procedures used to meet 
  missions, goals, and objectives. Internal controls help safeguard assets and 
  prevent and detect errors and fraud. Assessing the internal control environment 
  is important since internal control is a critical part of performance-based 
  management. SSA's internal control environment helps its managers achieve desired 
  results through effective stewardship of public resources. <br>
  <br>
  SSA is responsible for implementing policies for the development of claims under 
  the DI and SSI programs. Disability determinations under DI and SSI are performed 
  by DDSs in each State in accordance with Federal regulations. Each DDS is responsible 
  for determining claimants' disabilities and ensuring adequate evidence is available 
  to support its determinations. Each DDS is authorized to purchase medical examinations, 
  x-rays, and laboratory tests on a consultative basis to supplement evidence 
  obtained from the claimants' physicians or other treating sources. There are 
  52 DDSs: 1 in each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
  SSA reimburses the DDS for 100 percent of allowable expenditures up to its approved 
  funding authorization. In FY 2005, SSA allocated over $1.7 billion to fund DDS 
  operations. <br>
  <br>
  During FY 2000 through July 2005, we conducted 39 DDS administrative cost audits. 
  In 20 of the 39 audits, we identified internal control weaknesses. For example, 
  we reported that improvements were needed to ensure Federal funds were properly 
  drawn and payments to medical providers were in accordance with Federal regulations. 
  The lack of effective internal controls can result in the mismanagement of Federal 
  resources and increase the risk of fraud.<br>
  <br>
  In 15 of the 39 DDS administrative cost audits, we reported about $21.2 million 
  in unallowable indirect costs. As a result, we initiated a separate review of 
  SSA's oversight of indirect costs. We reported that SSA needed to improve its 
  oversight of indirect costs claimed by DDSs to ensure SSA funds obligated by 
  DDSs benefited SSA and were equitably distributed to its programs.<br>
  <br>
  Congress, external interested parties, and the general public need sound data 
  to monitor and evaluate SSA's performance. SSA relies primarily on internally 
  generated data to manage the information it uses to administer its programs 
  and report to Congress and the public. The necessity for good internal data 
  Government-wide has resulted in the passage of several laws, including the Government 
  Performance and Results Act. In addition to legislation calling for greater 
  accountability within the Government, the PMA has focused on the integration 
  of the budget and performance measurement processes. The PMA calls for agencies 
  to, over time, identify high quality outcome measures, accurately monitor programs' 
  performance, and integrate this presentation with associated costs.<br>
  <br>
  SSA sets forth its mission and strategic goals in strategic plans, establishes 
  yearly targets in its annual performance plan, and reports on its performance 
  annually. Each year, we assess the reliability of SSA's performance data and 
  evaluate the extent to which SSA's performance measures describe its planned 
  and actual performance. Assessing the control environment over DDSs and SSA's 
  performance measures helps ensure the Agency is managing its resources to meet 
  its mission. <br>
  In FY 2006, we plan to complete 20 reviews, begin 19 reviews, and oversee the 
  reviews of <br>
  16 performance measures in this area. <br>
  <br>
  We Plan to Complete the Following Reviews in FY 2006 <br>

<p>We Plan to Oversee Reviews of 16 Performance Indicators </p>
<p> Administrative Costs Claimed by State Disability Determination Services <br>
  |<br>
  Objective<br>
  We will be conducting reviews in the following State DDSs: Indiana, Louisiana, 
  Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, 
  Washington D.C., and Wisconsin to: <br>
  1. Evaluate the DDS' internal controls over the accounting and reporting of 
  administrative costs, <br>
  2. Determine whether costs claimed by the DDS were allowable and funds were 
  properly drawn, and <br>
  3. Assess limited areas of the general security controls environment. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The DI program was established in 1956 under Title II of the Social Security 
  Act. The program is designed to provide benefits to wage earners and their families 
  in the event the wage earner becomes disabled. In 1972, Congress enacted the 
  SSI program under Title XVI of the Social Security Act. The SSI program provides 
  a nationally uniform program of income to financially needy individuals who 
  are aged, blind or disabled. Disability determinations under DI and SSI are 
  performed by an agency in each State in accordance with Federal regulations. 
  In carrying out its obligation, each State agency is responsible for determining 
  the claimants' disabilities and ensuring adequate evidence is available to support 
  its determinations. DDSs are authorized to purchase consultative examinations 
  to supplement evidence obtained from the claimants' physicians or other treating 
  sources. SSA pays the DDS for 100 percent of allowable expenditures.<br>
  <br>
  Controls over Representative Payee Accounting of Social Security Funds (Public 
  Law 108-203)<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To ensure annual representative payee accounting is done timely and accurately 
  and that, when the accounting is not completed, SSA takes appropriate action.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 was signed into law on March 2, 2004. 
  It gives SSA the authority to redirect delivery of benefit payments when a representative 
  payee fails to provide a required accounting report. The provision was effective 
  September 2004.<br>
  <br>
  Costs Claimed by the Virginia Commonwealth University on Contract Number 600-99-38679 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether costs claimed by the Virginia Commonwealth University were 
  allowable, allocable and reasonable according to applicable Federal regulations 
  and the terms of the contract. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA's Office of Acquisition and Grants requested an audit of costs Virginia 
  Commonwealth University incurred for Contract Number 600-99-38679. This contract 
  was awarded to Virginia Commonwealth University to continue its development 
  of a prototype software decision tool that would let SSA determine the net benefit 
  effects for beneficiaries considering returning to work. Virginia Commonwealth 
  University claimed $2.1 million for the contracted service period from September 
  30, 1999 through March 29, 2005. <br>
  <br>
  Disclosure Statement for MAXIMUS Human Services Operations<br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To ensure the adequacy of the disclosure statement submitted by MAXIMUS for 
  its Human Services segment, effective <br>
  October 1, 2003. Specifically, we will determine whether the disclosure statement: 
  <br>
  is current, accurate, complete and adequately describes the contractor's cost 
  accounting practices. <br>
  In addition, we will determine whether the disclosed practices comply with Federal 
  cost accounting standards.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA contracted with MAXIMUS to manage the Ticket to Work program. Because of 
  the proportion of contract funding provided to MAXIMUS, SSA has been designated 
  with audit oversight for FYs 2000 through 2003. As the cognizant agency, SSA 
  is required to review, negotiate, and approve MAXIMUS' cost allocation plans 
  or indirect cost proposals on behalf of all Federal agencies. After FY 2003, 
  SSA is cognizant for those contracts under the MAXIMUS Human Services Operations 
  segment. During FY 2005, MAXIMUS submitted to SSA's Office of Acquisition and 
  Grants a disclosure statement, effective October 1, 2003, for the Human Services 
  Operations segment. The disclosure statement indicates cost accounting practices 
  and changes since the prior submission. As the cognizant agency, SSA has requested 
  we conduct an adequacy determination of the disclosure statement.<br>
  <br>
  Fiscal Year 2005 Financial Statement Audit Oversight <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To fulfill our responsibilities under the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 
  and related legislation for ensuring the quality of the audit work performed, 
  we will monitor PricewaterhouseCoopers' audit of SSA's FY 2005 financial statements. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 requires that agencies annually prepare 
  audited financial statements. Each agency's Inspector General is responsible 
  for auditing these financial statements to determine whether they provide a 
  fair representation of the entity's financial position. This annual audit also 
  includes an assessment of the Agency's internal control structure and its compliance 
  with laws and regulations. PricewaterhouseCoopers will perform the audit work 
  to support this opinion of SSA's financial statement. We will monitor the contract 
  to ensure the reliability of PricewaterhouseCoopers' work to meet our statutory 
  requirements for auditing the Agency's financial statements.<br>
  <br>
  Fiscal Year 2005 Inspector General Statement on the Social Security Administration's 
  Major Management Challenges<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To summarize and assess SSA's progress in addressing its most serious management 
  and performance challenges as identified by the OIG. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In November 2000, the President signed the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000, 
  which requires that Inspectors General provide a summary and assessment of the 
  most serious management and performance challenges facing the agencies and the 
  agencies' progress in addressing these challenges. <br>
  We identified the following management challenges for FY 2005. <br>
  Social Security Number Protection <br>
  Management of the Disability Process <br>
  Improper Payments<br>
  Internal Control Environment and Performance Measures <br>
  Systems Security and Critical Infrastructure Protection<br>
  Service Delivery <br>
  We will summarize each challenge and document actions SSA has taken to address 
  them.<br>
  <br>
  Indirect Cost Rates for MAXIMUS, Inc. <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To review the indirect cost rates used by MAXIMUS and recommend adjustments 
  to those rates, as necessary, for FYs 2000 through 2003. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  MAXIMUS offers various services to Federal clients and has worked with over 
  100 agencies and offices over its 28-year history. Some of the services provided 
  are financial management and consulting, research and evaluation studies, education, 
  health care, and human resource management consulting. <br>
  <br>
  MAXIMUS must submit indirect cost proposals to the cognizant Federal agency 
  for approval. For the 4 years of our audit, SSA was the cognizant agency.<br>
  <br>
  Indirect Costs for the Connecticut Disability Determination Services for the 
  Period July 1, 2003 - September 30, 2005<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the indirect costs for the Connecticut DDS for the period <br>
  July 1, 2003 - September 30, 2005 and follow up on prior recommendations.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Disability determinations are performed by DDSs in each State or other responsible 
  jurisdictions according to Federal regulations. Each DDS is responsible for 
  determining claimants' disabilities and ensuring adequate evidence is available 
  to support its determinations. SSA reimburses the DDS for 100 percent of the 
  allowable expenditures, including direct and indirect costs. <br>
  <br>
  SSA requested this audit in response to a prior Audit of the Administrative 
  Costs Claimed by the Connecticut Disability Determination Services. Specifically, 
  SSA raised the issue of rising indirect costs resulting from the State of Connecticut's 
  change in methodology for determining indirect costs from an indirect cost rate 
  agreement to a Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plan.<br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Compliance with Employee Tax Requirements<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA is (1) appropriately paying employment taxes on wages 
  and (2) reporting required wage information and other payments on the designated 
  IRS forms.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Federal agencies are subject to the same requirements as all employers. The 
  Internal Revenue Code requires that employers pay employment taxes on wages 
  and report wages and certain other payments on various IRS forms. Federal employment 
  taxes include Federal income tax withholdings, social security, and Medicare 
  taxes. Employers are required to deposit employment taxes on a daily, weekly, 
  or semi-weekly schedule depending on the amount of tax they accumulate for deposits.<br>
  <br>
  Performance Indicator Audits: The Social Security Administration's Performance 
  Data <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the reliability of the performance data SSA uses to measure selected 
  performance indicators <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 to bring 
  greater accountability to Federal agencies. The Government Performance and Results 
  Act established a system for strategic and annual performance planning and reporting 
  to set goals for program performance and to measure results. The law requires 
  that each agency create <br>
  (1) 5-year strategic plans, (2) annual performance plans, and (3) annual performance 
  reports. SSA released its latest strategic plan in 2003, which covers FYs 2003 
  through 2008. The Agency's latest annual performance plan was released in March 
  2005. It presents the annual performance indicators and goals for FY 2006. SSA 
  established 4 strategic goals, and 44 Government Performance and Results Act 
  performance measures, and an additional 9 Program Assessment Rating Tool performance 
  measures. <br>
  <br>
  The success of SSA's performance measurement initiatives hinges on the quality 
  of the data used to measure and report upon program performance. Consequently, 
  it is important that SSA have assurance the data reported are reliable and meaningful 
  and its performance report will be useful to the Congress and Agency management. 
  <br>
  <br>
  As a result, we will award a contract to test SSA's performance data and the 
  systems from which they are generated to gain assurance that the data reported 
  in the performance plan are reliable and meaningful. We will oversee the contractor, 
  who will assess the reliability of the performance data used with the following 
  performance measures.<br>
  Agency Decisional Accuracy Rate<br>
  Align Employee Performance with Agency Mission and Strategic Goals<br>
  Average Processing Time for Hearings <br>
  Average Processing Time for Initial Disability Claims<br>
  DDS Cases Processed Per Workyear<br>

  Services<br>
  Optimize the 800-Number Agent Busy Rate<br>
  Optimize the Speed in Answering 800-Number Calls<br>
  Reduce the Average Number of Days Needed to Process Hearings Appeals</p>
<p> The information technology revolution has changed the way governments and 
  businesses operate. Today, the growth in computer interconnectivity brings a 
  heightened risk of disrupting or sabotaging critical operations, reading or 
  copying sensitive data, and tampering with critical processes. Those who wish 
  to disrupt or sabotage critical operations have more tools than ever. The United 
  States works to protect the people, economy, essential services, and national 
  security by ensuring that any disruptions are infrequent, manageable, of minimal 
  duration, and cause the least damage possible. The Government must continually 
  strive to secure information systems for critical infrastructures. <br>
  <br>
  SSA's information security challenge is to understand and mitigate system vulnerabilities. 
  At SSA, this means ensuring the security of its critical information infrastructure, 
  such as access to the Internet and its networks. By improving systems security 
  and controls, SSA will be able to use current and future technology more effectively 
  to fulfill the public's needs. The public will not use electronic access to 
  SSA services if it does not believe those systems are secure. SSA addresses 
  critical information infrastructure and systems security in a variety of ways. 
  For example, it has created a Critical Infrastructure Protection work group 
  that works toward compliance with various directives, such as the Homeland Security 
  Presidential Directives (HSPD) and the Federal Information Security Management 
  Act of 2002. Additionally, SSA created the Office of Information Technology 
  Security Policy within the Office of the Chief Information Officer. <br>
  <br>
  HSPD 7 requires that all Federal department and agency heads identify, prioritize, 
  assess, remediate, and protect their respective critical infrastructure and 
  key resources. To comply with HSPD 7, SSA submitted its Critical Federal Infrastructure 
  Protection Plan to OMB in 2004. SSA continues to work with OMB to resolve any 
  outstanding issues regarding its plan. We have worked with SSA to help meet 
  these requirements. The Agency plans must address identification, prioritization, 
  protection, and contingency planning, including the recovery and reconstitution 
  of essential capabilities. <br>
  <br>
  HSPD 12 mandates the development of a common identification Standard for all 
  Federal employees and contractors. The Agency recently created a work group 
  that coordinates with other Agencies and OMB to address HSPD 12. We plan to 
  evaluate SSA's efforts to comply with HSPD 12, as required by Federal Information 
  Processing Standards 201. <br>
  <br>
  Another important systems security issue is the restriction of physical access 
  to the Agency's systems and data. We reported on physical security problems 
  at several hearing offices and noted that non-SSA employees were allowed inappropriate 
  access to secured areas. Though the managers at these sites took prompt action 
  to remedy the security breaches, we believe the same security concerns may be 
  present at other hearing offices. Because of our findings at several hearing 
  offices, we plan to expand our reviews to determine whether OHA has established 
  adequate physical security controls at its numerous remote hearing sites.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, under the Federal Information Security Management Act, we independently 
  evaluate SSA's security program. Systems security is a key component of this 
  initiative, and we will continue to work with the Agency to resolve outstanding 
  issues so it can reach green on the Electronic Government Scorecard.<br>
  <br>
  In FY 2006, we plan to complete 16 reviews and begin 7 reviews in this area.<br>
  <br>
  We Plan to Complete the Following Reviews in FY 2006<br>
  Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 Personal Identification 
  Verification Guidelines in Federal Information Processing Standards 201 <br>
  Fiscal Year 2006 Federal Information Security Management Act <br>
  Physical Security at Remote Hearing Sites (10 reviews conducted) <br>
  Physical Security at the Great Lakes, Northeastern and Southeastern Program

  The Social Security Administration's E-mail Security </p>
<p>We Plan to Begin the Following Reviews in FY 2006<br>
  Death Alert Control and Update System <br>
  Follow-up: Information System Controls for the Social Security Administration's 
  Representative Payee System<br>
  General Controls Review of the Florida Disability Determination Service Administration 
  Office<br>

  Center<br>
  Physical Security at the Mid-America Program Service Center <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Implementation of Active Directory<br>
  The Social Security Administration's Patch Management Process</p>
<p>Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 Personal Identification 
  Verification Guidelines in Federal Information Processing Standards 201 <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate SSA's compliance with HSPD 12, as required by Federal Information 
  Processing Standards 201. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  HSPD 12 mandates the development of a common identification &quot;Standard&quot; 
  for all Federal employees and contractors and establishes milestones for adoption 
  of the new identification Standard. HSPD 12 requires that the heads of executive 
  departments and agencies, require the use of identification by Federal employees 
  and contractors that meets the Standard in gaining physical access to federally 
  controlled facilities and logical access to federally controlled information 
  systems. HSPD 12 requires that agencies identify and validate that every Federal 
  employee and contractor have at least a National Agency Check and Inquiry or 
  higher security investigation on file. <br>
  <br>
  In response to HSPD 12, National Institute of Standards and Technology published 
  Federal Information Processing Standards 201. Federal Information Processing 
  Standards 201 sets the &quot;Standard&quot; for Government-wide reliable Personal 
  Identification Verification for Federal employees and contractors. Federal Information 
  Processing Standards 201 addresses the fundamental control and security objectives 
  of HSPD 12. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Fiscal Year 2006 Federal Information Security Management Act <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA is in compliance with the Federal Information Security 
  Management Act for FY 2006. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Federal Information Security Management Act requires that Agencies maintain 
  an agency-wide information security program. Annual reviews of the security 
  program are performed by the agency and the OIG. Each year, OMB issues questions 
  to be answered concerning agencies' compliance with the Federal Information 
  Security Management Act. <br>
  <br>
  Physical Security at Remote Hearing Sites (10 Reviews Conducted)<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To review controls over physical security in OHA's remote hearing sites. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  OHA conducts work at remote sites to accommodate the hearing requests of individuals 
  who do not live near a hearing office. OHA conducts about 40 percent of its 
  hearings in remote sites.<br>
  <br>
  OHA establishes temporary or permanent remote sites based on case receipts, 
  service to the claimant, and cost factors. Employees who work at these remote 
  sites (1) may operate in locations not under Government control, (2) perform 
  their duties alone or in teams of 2 or 3 employees, and/or (3) are normally 
  not accompanied by management officials. <br>
  <br>
  Employees who work at remote hearing sites may need additional security measures 
  because of their isolation from other OHA offices. <br>
  <br>
  Physical Security at the Great Lakes, Northeastern and Southeastern Program 
  Service Centers<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine (1) what actions SSA has taken to address physical security vulnerabilities 
  identified in prior reviews and (2) whether physical security standards used 
  by other Federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense and VA, can be 
  applied to SSA facilities. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Following the 1994 Oklahoma City bombing, a DoJ study created minimum physical 
  security standards for Federal buildings. The President directed Federal agencies 
  to upgrade the physical security of their facilities based on DoJ's recommendations. 
  SSA placed its version of the DoJ standards into its Administrative Instructions 
  Manual System. <br>
  <br>
  Recently, several Federal agencies have published physical security guidelines 
  that go beyond the DoJ minimum standards. In 2002, the Department of Defense 
  issued a report entitled, DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings, 
  and made it available to the general public. A VA Task Group recently recommended 
  that all VA facilities adopt the Department of Defense standards. The Federal 
  Emergency Management Administration published considerable scientific research 
  to support that buildings not meeting Department of Defense standards are vulnerable 
  to catastrophic consequences if subjected to a terrorist attack. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's E-mail Security <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate the adequacy of SSA's electronic mail (e-mail) services security 
  controls designed to ensure confidentiality, availability, and integrity of 
  sensitive information. As part of the audit, we will evaluate SSA's management, 
  operational, and technical controls related to e-mail security for consistency 
  with Federal standards and guidelines and industry best practices. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  E-mail is used extensively within SSA for operational and business communications. 
  Sensitive data are often sent via e-mail within, as well as outside, SSA. In 
  today's network environment, e-mail is also a preferred path by hackers to distribute 
  viruses, worms, and spam. It is critical to protect information sent or received 
  via e-mail from unauthorized use, disclosure, modification, destruction, or 
  exploitation. <br>
  <br>
  SSA's e-mail system is based on the Microsoft Outlook Exchange 2003 software 
  product. Employees can access their e-mail either from within SSA or remotely 
  via a workstation (desktop or laptop). SSA employees can also use e-mail when 
  communicating with individuals outside the Agency. <br>
  <br>
  One of SSA's goals is to deliver high-quality, &quot;citizen-centered&quot; 
  service. This goal encompasses traditional and electronic services to applicants 
  for benefits, beneficiaries and the general public. It includes services to 
  and from States, other agencies, third parties, employers, and other organizations, 
  including financial institutions and medical providers. This area includes basic 
  operational services, and three of the greatest challenges in the area are the 
  representative payee process, managing human capital and electronic Government.<br>
  <br>
  Representative Payee Process <br>
  <br>
  When SSA determines a beneficiary cannot manage his or her benefits, SSA selects 
  a representative payee who must use the payments for the beneficiary's needs. 
  There are about 5.4 million representative payees who manage benefit payments 
  for 6.9 million beneficiaries. While representative payees provide a valuable 
  service for beneficiaries, SSA must provide appropriate safeguards to ensure 
  they meet their responsibilities to the beneficiaries they serve. <br>
  We have completed several audits of representative payees. Our audits have identified 
  deficiencies with the accounting for benefit receipts and disbursements, vulnerabilities 
  in the safeguarding of beneficiary payments, poor monitoring and reporting to 
  SSA of changes in beneficiary circumstances, inappropriate handling of beneficiary-conserved 
  funds, and<br>
  improper charging of fees.<br>
  <br>
  In March 2004, the President signed into law the Social Security Protection 
  Act of 2004. This Act provides several new safeguards for those individuals 
  who need a representative payee. In addition, it presents significant challenges 
  to SSA to ensure representative payees meet beneficiaries' needs. For example, 
  it requires that SSA conduct periodic on-site reviews of representative payees 
  and a statistically valid survey to determine how payments made to representative 
  payees are being used. It also authorizes SSA to impose civil monetary penalties 
  for offenses involving misuse of benefits received by a representative payee. 
  In FY 2006, we plan to conduct reviews that focus on SSA's efforts to implement 
  the provisions of the Social Security Protection Act of 2004.<br>
  <br>
  Managing Human Capital<br>
  <br>
  SSA, like many other Federal agencies, is being challenged to address its human 
  capital shortfalls. As of January 2005, GAO has continued to identify strategic 
  human capital management on its list of high-risk Federal programs and operations. 
  GAO initially identified human capital management as high-risk in January 2001. 
  In addition, Strategic Management of Human Capital is one of five Government-wide 
  initiatives contained in the PMA. <br>
  <br>
  By the end of 2012, SSA projects its DI and Old-Age and Survivors Insurance 
  benefit rolls will increase by 35 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Further, 
  by FY 2014, SSA projects 56 percent of SSA's employees will be eligible to retire. 
  This retirement wave will result in a loss of institutional knowledge that will 
  affect SSA's ability to deliver quality service to the public. <br>
  Along with the workload increase, the incredible pace of technological change 
  will have a profound impact on both the public's expectations and SSA's ability 
  to meet those expectations. In the face of these challenges, technology is essential 
  to achieving efficiencies and enabling employees to deliver the kind of service 
  that every claimant, beneficiary and citizen needs and deserves.<br>
  <br>
  SSA's Office of Systems is responsible for guiding and managing the development, 
  acquisition, and use of the information technology resources that support the 
  Agency's program and business functions. The Office of Systems estimates 66 
  percent of its FY 2003 Information Technology workforce will be eligible for 
  retirement over the next 10 years.<br>
  The critical loss of institutional skills and knowledge, combined with greatly 
  increased workloads at a time when the baby-boom generation will require its 
  services must be addressed by succession planning, strong recruitment efforts, 
  and the effective use of technology. As of June 30, 2005, SSA continued to score 
  &quot;green&quot; in &quot;Progress in Implementing the President's Management 
  Agenda&quot; on the OMB Scorecard. <br>
  <br>
  Electronic Government<br>
  The Expanded Electronic Government, or &quot;e-Government,&quot; initiative 
  of the PMA directs the expanded use of the Internet to provide faster and better 
  access to Government services and information. Specifically, e-Government instructs 
  SSA to help citizens find information and obtain services organized according 
  to their needs. <br>
  <br>
  According to SSA, its e-Government strategy is based on the deployment of high-volume, 
  high-payoff applications, for both the public and the Agency's business partners. 
  To meet increasing public demands, SSA has pursued a portfolio of services that 
  enable on-line transactions and increase opportunities for the public to conduct 
  SSA business electronically in a private and secure environment. <br>
  <br>
  Over the past 6 years, SSA has launched the Internet Social Security Benefit 
  Application and created on-line requests for Social Security Statements, replacement 
  Medicare cards, proof of income letters and change of address. The Agency also 
  added more on-line reports, such as the Adult Disability and Work History Report, 
  the Childhood Disability Report and the Appeals Disability Report.<br>
  <br>
  In FY 2006, we plan to complete 14 reviews and begin 9 reviews in this area.<br>
  <br>
  We Plan to Complete the Following Reviews in FY 2006<br>

  to the pen-and-ink or &quot;wet&quot; signatures on applications for benefits.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA is evolving its claims-taking process to an electronic environment. To eliminate 
  the need for retaining paper applications, SSA implemented three signature proxy 
  alternatives to the pen-and-ink or &quot;wet&quot; signatures required on applications 
  for Title II and XVI benefit payments. The signature alternatives apply to cases 
  processed on or after June 21, 2004 in SSA's Modernized Claims and the Modernized 
  Supplemental Security Income Systems. The three types of signature proxies implemented 
  by SSA are: (1) Attestation; (2) Witnessed Signature; and (3) Click and Sign.<br>
  <br>
  Assessment of the Implementation of Workers' Compensation Offset in Title II 
  Redesign Release 3<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess changes to the WC portion of the Title II Initial Claim and Post Entitlement 
  System made with the Title II Redesign Release 3 project.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Section 223 of the Social Security Act requires that SSA provide monthly DI 
  benefits to individuals who meet specific disability requirements. Workers injured 
  on the job may qualify for DI benefits in addition to benefits under Federal 
  and State WC programs. However, combined DI and WC benefits could result in 
  workers receiving more in disability payments than they earned before they became 
  disabled. To prevent this, Congress enacted the WC offset provision under section 
  224 of the Social Security Act, which requires that SSA reduce DI benefits by 
  the amount of any other disability benefit paid under any law or plan of the 
  United States, a State, or a political subdivision. In each instance, SSA reduces 
  the DI benefit unless the other disability payment originates in a State with 
  a &quot;reverse offset&quot; law. For States with a recognized &quot;reverse 
  offset&quot; law, the WC benefit would be reduced.<br>
  <br>
  In July 2004, SSA implemented Title II Redesign Release 3 to reduce manual tasks, 
  improve the quality of the data stored on the master records, and reduce the 
  number of actions that result in exceptions that have to be worked by processing 
  center technicians by 50 percent. As a result of the Redesign, new data collected 
  and stored on the Master Beneficiary Record captures additional historical information 
  and aids field personnel in claims development and post-entitlement actions.<br>
  <br>
  Beneficiaries in Suspended Payment Status Pending the Selection of a Representative 
  Payee <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA has adequate controls to ensure payments to beneficiaries 
  are not improperly withheld pending the selection of a representative payee. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA selects representative payees for OASDI beneficiaries and SSI recipients 
  when representative payments would serve the individual's interests. <br>
  <br>
  SSA policy states that benefits should not be suspended when a beneficiary requires 
  a representative payee and none is immediately available. Instead, benefits 
  must be paid directly to the beneficiary while SSA searches for an individual 
  or organization to serve as a representative payee. However, direct payment 
  is prohibited to beneficiaries who are legally incompetent and beneficiaries 
  who are under age 15. Finally, benefits can be suspended for a maximum of 1 
  month, if SSA determines direct payments to the beneficiary would cause &quot;substantial 
  harm.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Concurrent Beneficiaries Receiving Representative Payee and Direct Payments 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  Determine whether SSA has adequate controls to prevent the direct payment of 
  concurrent OASDI and SSI benefit payments to individuals who have been appointed 
  a representative payee. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Some individuals cannot manage or direct the management of their finances because 
  of their youth or mental and/or physical impairments. Congress granted SSA the 
  authority to appoint representative payees to receive and manage these beneficiaries' 
  and recipients' benefit payments. SSA selects representative payees for OASDI 
  beneficiaries or SSI recipients when representative payments would serve the 
  individual's interest. <br>
  <br>
  About 6.9 million individuals have representative payees. Of these, approximately 
  800,000 are concurrently entitled under the OASDI and SSI programs. Generally, 
  if SSA has made a determination that an individual is incapable of receiving 
  direct payment under one of its programs, a similar decision would be warranted 
  under the other program. <br>
  <br>
  Follow-up: The Social Security Administration's Management of Congressional 
  Inquiries <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the extent to which SSA implemented recommendations from our September 
  2002 evaluation report concerning its management of congressional inquiries. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Our September 2002 report stated SSA lacked an adequate national system of internal 
  controls related to its management of congressional inquiries. We found no Agency-wide 
  automated system for controlling, monitoring, and tracking inquiries. SSA could 
  not identify the total number of congressional inquiries it received; no component 
  was designated the responsibility of managing congressional inquiries nationwide; 
  and multiple components were not complying with Agency-wide policies and procedures 
  when responding to congressional inquiries. <br>
  <br>
  The Agency agreed with two of our three recommendations. In addition, the Agency 
  stated &quot;In the spring of 2000, the Office of the Commissioner began efforts 
  to replace the Commissioner's Correspondence System (CCS) with more current 
  technology, which would enhance the Agency's ability to track correspondence 
  processing as well as to facilitate document management. This commercial document 
  management and workflow software product will form the core of our nationwide 
  Assignment and Correspondence Tracking (ACT) application.&quot; </p>
<p></p>
<p>Follow-up: The Social Security Administration's Procedures to Identify Representative 
  Payees Who Are Deceased <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To follow up on the recommendations in our September 1999 report. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Our FY 1999 report stated that about 2,091 deceased representative payees received 
  about $17.3 million in OASDI and SSI benefit payments from the date of the payee's 
  death through June 1998. Since SSA was not aware that payments had been made 
  to these deceased payees, the Agency could not be sure the funds had been used 
  for the sole benefit of the intended beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  We also found several conditions that affected the completeness and accuracy 
  of SSA's payee data files and adversely affected our ability to match these 
  files with the Agency's Death Master File. We recommended that SSA (1) routinely 
  match the Death Master File against the Master Representative Payee File, (2) 
  emphasize the correct procedures to be performed to ensure funds paid to deceased 
  payees are accounted for and transferred to the new payee, (3) correct instances 
  where erroneous dates of death are contained on Master Beneficiary Records, 
  (4) correct instances where the payee's SSN on the Master Beneficiary and Supplemental 
  Security Records were erroneous, (5) implement an edit to ensure the payee's 
  SSN is updated on the Master Beneficiary Record whenever a new payee is added, 
  and (6) identify representative payees for SSI recipients who are not included 
  in the Master Representative Payee File.<br>
  <br>
  New System to Provide Disabled Beneficiaries Receipts for Work Activity<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA's development of a new system to provide receipts to disabled 
  beneficiaries when they report work and earnings and assess SSA's integration 
  of the new system into its current architecture.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 contains a provision that requires 
  that SSA issue a receipt to disabled beneficiaries each time they report their 
  work and earnings. This provision is effective as soon as possible but no later 
  than 1 year after enactment and until such time as SSA implements a centralized 
  computer file.<br>
  <br>
  Referral of Information from the Telephone Service Centers to the Responsible 
  Field Offices <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether calls received on SSA's 800-number that require FO involvement 
  are being routed to the FO timely and the FO is timely resolving the pending 
  issues. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA customers frequently contact SSA using the national 800-number to report 
  changes that affect SSI eligibility and payment amounts (such as changes in 
  address/living arrangements, income, and resources). SSA operating instructions 
  require that teleservice representatives make any appropriate changes to the 
  pending SSI event and, in some circumstances, transfer ownership of the event 
  to the FO for further development and resolution.<br>
  <br>
  Representative Payee On-site Reviews of State Institutions <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate the adequacy of SSA's Representative Payee Onsite Review Program 
  for State hospitals and developmental centers. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Social Security Disability Benefits Reform Act of 1984 requires that State 
  hospitals and developmental centers be reviewed once every 3 years. The purpose 
  of the on-site reviews is to: <br>
  explore how SSA and State institutions can improve mutual understanding and 
  work toward resolving common problems applicable to the beneficiaries for whom 
  the institution serves as representative payee, <br>
  determine whether a State institution's performance as representative payee 
  conforms with SSA's policies regarding use of benefits and reporting of significant 
  events, and <br>
  determine the extent to which recommendations made in prior reviews have been 
  implemented and take appropriate action to ensure compliance with SSA's policies. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Representative Payees Receiving Benefits for Children in Foster Care <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether beneficiaries and recipients in the Baltimore City Department 
  of Social Services' foster care program had their benefit payments managed by 
  representative payees who were not their foster care parents and whether these 
  funds were at-risk. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Some individuals cannot manage or direct the management of their finances because 
  of their youth or mental and/or physical impairments. Congress granted SSA the 
  authority to appoint representative payees to receive and manage these beneficiaries' 
  and recipients' benefit payments. A representative payee may be an individual 
  or an organization. SSA selects representative payees for OASDI beneficiaries 
  and SSI recipients when representative payments would serve the individual's 
  interests. Parents or relatives often serve as representative payees for children 
  receiving benefit payments from these SSA-administered programs.<br>
  <br>
  The Social Services Administration of the State of Maryland, Department of Human 
  Resources, administers social services in each of Maryland's 23 counties and 
  Baltimore City through local departments of social services. The local department 
  of social services provides adoption, protective and foster care services to 
  children and families with children. <br>
  <br>
  Restitution of Misused Funds to Beneficiaries Under Public Law 108-203 <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA's implementation of section 101 of the Social Security Protection 
  Act of 2004. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 requires that SSA reissue benefits 
  to beneficiaries when such benefits were misused by organizational representative 
  payees or individual payees serving 15 or more beneficiaries. This provision 
  applies to misuse decisions made January 1, 1995 and later. <br>
  <br>
  Before this law, SSA was liable to the affected beneficiary for repayment of 
  the amount of misused benefits only if SSA's negligence in its failure to investigate 
  or monitor a representative payee resulted in the misuse of benefits. <br>
  SSA identified 185 representative payees and 2,674 beneficiaries who met the 
  requirements of section 101 of the Social Security Protection Act of 2004. SSA 
  established the Misuse Restitution Control System to manage the completion of 
  these cases. SSA's FOs processed the Title XVI cases and Title II/XVI concurrent 
  cases, while both the FOs and program service centers processed the Title II 
  cases. <br>
  <br>
  Scott County Community Services-A Fee-for-Service Representative Payee for the 
  Social Security Administration<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether Scott County Community Services as a representative payee 
  for SSA (1) has effective safeguards over the receipt and disbursement of Social 
  Security benefits and (2) uses and accounts for Social Security benefits in 
  accordance with SSA's policies and procedures.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA provides benefits to the most vulnerable members of society - the young, 
  the elderly, and disabled. Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint representative 
  payees for those beneficiaries judged incapable of managing or directing the 
  management of their benefits. Representative payees (organizations or individuals) 
  receive and manage payments on behalf of these beneficiaries. Given the vulnerability 
  of the beneficiaries and the risk a representative payee may misuse beneficiaries' 
  funds, it is imperative that SSA have appropriate safeguards to ensure representative 
  payees meet their responsibilities.<br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Nation-wide Asbestos Program <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the validity of allegations of mismanagement regarding SSA's asbestos 
  program. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA has a nation-wide asbestos management program, which was established in 
  accordance with the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Reauthorization Act. The program 
  includes the assessment, management, operations and maintenance, and abatement 
  of asbestos.<br>
  <br>
  In November 1999, we issued a report, Selected Procedures Used in the Social 
  Security Administration's Asbestos Management Program for its Main Complex. 
  We reported that SSA work sites were not monitored to ensure compliance with 
  standard operating procedures for asbestos containment, and work order approvals 
  were appropriate but lacked quality assurance review. SSA concurred with our 
  findings and reported that action was underway to implement our recommendations. 
  However, several of the allegations raised concerns about SSA's management of 
  its Nation-wide Asbestos Program. Some of these concerns are similar to issues 
  identified during our prior review.<br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Office of Systems' Training Program <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate the Office of Systems' process for providing training to current 
  staff and new hires. We will review training opportunities, types of training 
  provided, and cost of training for current Office of Systems staff and new hires 
  to enhance skills/competencies needed to meet future workloads.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  For SSA to meet its customers' future needs, it must restructure its systems' 
  processes to effectively use new technologies and ensure it has staff trained 
  to apply those technologies. Technologies expected to be commonplace in 2010 
  include a rapidly evolving Internet, advances involving speech and video, and 
  a wide range of wireless, portable, connective devices. <br>
  A January 2003 GAO report, Major Management Challenges and Program Risks: Social 
  Security Administration, stated &quot;As SSA places increased emphasis on using 
  information technology to support new ways of delivering service, it must also 
  ensure that it effectively manages its human capital to anticipate, plan for, 
  and support its requirements&#133;Doing so is necessary to ensure that SSA's 
  plans project workforce needs far enough in advance to allow adequate time for 
  staff recruitment and hiring, skills refreshment and training. . . .&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The Office of Systems guides and manages the development, acquisition, and use 
  of SSA's information technology resources. These resources support the Agency's 
  program and business functions. Within the Division of Process Engineering, 
  Project, and Customer Service, the Systems Training and Communications Branch 
  manages and administers the Office of Systems' Technical Training Program. <br>
