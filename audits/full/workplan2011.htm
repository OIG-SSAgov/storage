I am pleased to present the Office of Audit&#146;s Fiscal Year 2011 Annual Work 
Plan (Plan). The reviews described in the Plan are designed to address those areas 
that are most vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Since 1997, we have provided 
our perspective on the top challenges facing SSA management to the Congress, Social 
Security Administration , and other key decisionmakers. For Fiscal Year 2011, 
the Office of the Inspector General has identified the following management challenges. 
. Implement the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Effectively and Efficiently 
. Improve Customer Service . Improve the Timeliness and Quality of the Disability 
Process . Improve Transparency and Accountability . Invest in Information Technology 
Infrastructure to Support Current and Future Workloads . Reduce Improper Payments 
and Increase Overpayment Recoveries . Reduce the Hearings Backlog and Prevent 
its Recurrence . Strengthen the Integrity and Protection of the Social Security 
Number The Plan describes 110 reviews we plan to complete in Fiscal Year 2011 
and 112 reviews we plan to begin in Fiscal Year 2011. In developing these reviews, 
we worked with Agency management to ensure we provide a coordinated effort. Our 
Plan is dynamic, so we encourage continuous feedback and additional study suggestions. 
This flexibility enables us to meet emerging and critical issues evolving during 
the upcoming year.

  <b>Annual Work Plan <br>
  Executive Overview </b><br>
  The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) improves the Social Security Administration&#146;s 
  (SSA) programs and operations and protects them against fraud, waste, and abuse 
  by conducting independent and objective audits, evaluations, and investigations. 
  We provide timely, useful, and reliable information and advice to Administration 
  officials, Congress, and the public. The Office of Audit conducts financial 
  and performance audits of SSA&#146;s programs and operations and makes recommendations 
  to ensure program objectives are achieved effectively and efficiently. Financial 
  audits assess the reliability of financial data reported by SSA in its annual 
  financial statements and any number of managerial information reports. Performance 
  audits review the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of SSA&#146;s programs 
  and operations. The Office of Audit also conducts short-term management and 
  program evaluations and projects on issues of concern to SSA, the Congress, 
  and the general public. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2010, we issued 108 reports with 
  over $4.5 billion in monetary findings. <br>
</p>
<p>Our Annual Work Plan (Plan) outlines our perspective of the major management 
  and performance challenges facing SSA and serves as a tool for communicating 
  our priorities to SSA, Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), 
  and other interested parties. While our list of management challenges has not 
  changed significantly in several years, SSA&#146;s environment has changed. 
  For example, the hearings backlog exceeds 700,000 cases, rising workloads have 
  added greater challenges to SSA&#146;s customer service, and passage of the 
  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act added additional workloads and reporting 
  responsibilities. These changes led us to revise our list of SSA&#146;s major 
  management and performance challenges in FY 2010. Our list has not changed for 
  FY 2011. <br>
  <br>
  Our work is prioritized to focus our resources on those areas that are most 
  vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. To ensure we provide a coordinated effort, 
  we work with our Offices of Investigations, Counsel to the Inspector General, 
  External Relations, and Technology and Resource Management. <br>
  In preparing this Plan, we solicited suggestions from the Agency. We received 
  a number of suggestions for inclusion in our Plan, and we have incorporated 
  as many of them as possible. <br>
  We recognize this Plan is dynamic, so we encourage continuous feedback and additional 
  suggestions. This flexibility enables us to meet emerging and critical issues 
  evolving throughout the upcoming year. <br>
  <br>
  To assist us in setting the major challenges, we cross-referenced the Commissioner 
  and the Social Security Advisory Board priorities to those identified by our 
  prior and ongoing work. The following table demonstrates that our perspective 
  is congruent with other key decisionmakers. <br>

  <br>
  <b>Implement the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 Effectively 
  and Efficiently <br>
  </b>On February 17, 2009, the President signed into law the American Recovery 
  and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), P.L. 111-5. The Administration committed 
  to investing ARRA funds with an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability 
  so Americans know where their tax dollars are going and how those dollars are 
  being spent. ARRA provided SSA funds in the following areas. <br>
  &#149; $500 million to replace SSA&#146;s National Computer Center (NCC); </p>
<p>&#149; $500 million to process disability and retirement workloads and information 
  technology (IT) acquisitions and research in support of these workloads; and 
</p>
<p>&#149; $90 million to reimburse costs to process a $250, one-time payment to 
  millions of qualified individuals receiving Social Security benefits and Supplemental 
  Security Income (SSI). </p>
<p>Congress provided $2 million for the OIG to oversee SSA programs, projects, 
  and activities funded by ARRA. <br>
  In FYs 2009 and 2010, we provided oversight of SSA&#146;s ARRA implementation 
  and issued 23 ARRA-related reports. In FY 2011, we will continue providing oversight 
  of SSA&#146;s ARRA implementation. Since the majority of the one-time ERPs has 
  been paid, we will concentrate our efforts in three areas. <br>
  In FY 2009, SSA identified five specific challenges it faced in implementing 
  ARRA: Overall ARRA Implementation, One-Time Economic Recovery Payment (ERP) 
  Administrative Expenses, One-Time ERP, Disability and Retirement Workloads, 
  and Replacement of the NCC. </p>
<p>1. Overall ARRA Implementation </p>
<p>2. Disability and Retirement Workloads </p>
<p>3. Replacement of the NCC </p>
<p><b>Overall ARRA Implementation </b><br>
  We will review SSA&#146;s efforts to ensure (1) recipients of ARRA funds properly 
  report to FederalReporting.gov and (2) Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG) 
  staff has appropriate knowledge, skills, and abilities. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Disability and Retirement Workloads </b><br>
  We will review SSA&#146;s efforts to invest in technology to enhance SSA&#146;s 
  ability to (1) eliminate the hearings backlog and prevent its recurrence, (2) 
  improve the speed and quality of the disability process, and (3) improve retiree 
  and other core services. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Replacement of the NCC </b><br>
  We will review SSA&#146;s efforts to ensure (1) proper overall project management, 
  proper site selection, proper facility, and infrastructure construction oversight; 
  (2) IT investments support SSA&#146;s strategic IT vision and plan; and (3) 
  the facility complies with the National Environmental Policy Act. <br>
  In FY 2011, we plan to complete six reviews and start four reviews in this area. 
  <br>
  We Plan to Complete the Following Reviews in FY 2011 <br>
  Contractors&#146; Reporting of Jobs Created Using Recovery Act Dollars in Fiscal 
  Year 2011 <br>
  Economic Recovery Payments - Catch-up Payments <br>
  National Computer Center Replacement Strategy Implementation <br>
  The Social Security Administration&#146;s Program of Requirements for its New 
  Data Center <br>
  The Social Security Administration&#146;s Use of Building Design Industry Best 
  Practices for its New Data Center <br>
  The Social Security Administration&#146;s Use of Recovery Act Funds to Administer 
  Economic Recovery Payments <br>
  We Plan to Begin the Following Reviews in FY 2011 <br>
  Contracts Issued Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act <br>
  Recovery Act Nationwide Health Information Network Contracts <br>
  The Social Security Administration&#146;s New Data Center Capabilities <br>
  The Social Security Administration&#146;s Recovery Act Contract with International 
  Business Machines, Incorporated <br>
  Contractors&#146; Reporting of Jobs Created Using Recovery Act Dollars in Fiscal 
  Year 2011 <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA has (1) continued verifying the number of jobs reported 
  as created by the recipients of ARRA awards and (2) review data quality of recipient 
  reports. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  ARRA was designed to save and create jobs, cushion the economic downturn, and 
  make crucial public investments. To evaluate the employment effects of ARRA, 
  all recipients of ARRA funds for Government investment are required to provide 
  a narrative description of the employment impact of ARRA-funded work. This description 
  should discuss the types of jobs created and retained, an estimate of the number 
  of jobs created and retained by the prime contractor, and information on the 
  direct job creation and retention. <br>
  Economic Recovery Payments - Catch-up Payments <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA accurately disbursed the catch-up ERPs to eligible 
  beneficiaries under ARRA. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  ARRA provides for a $250, one-time ERP to adult Social Security and SSI recipients. 
  Individuals eligible for benefits from SSA in November 2008, December 2008, 
  or January 2009, were eligible to receive an ERP. SSA paid the vast majority 
  of the ERPs in FY 2009, but there were some beneficiaries eligible for ERPs 
  who were identified at later dates. <br>
  National Computer Center Replacement Strategy Implementation <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To provide periodic status reports on SSA&#146;s implementation of its NCC Replacement 
  Strategy. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  While the NCC was once a state-of-the-art data center, it is now over 30 years 
  old, and its infrastructure systems have exceeded their useful life of 15 to 
  20 years. SSA is working to build a new facility. The construction of a new 
  data center is at the core of SSA&#146;s IT strategy. Thus, this initiative 
  supports all four of the strategic goals in SSA&#146;s Strategic Plan. SSA is 
  developing plans and site criteria and conducting studies for the purchase of 
  the land to construct the new data center, including the development of a program 
  of requirements, detailed project plan, and timeline. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Social Security Administration&#146;s Program of Requirements for its 
  New Data Center </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA followed best practices in developing its overall Program 
  of Requirements for the new data center. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  We contracted with Strategic e-Business Solutions, Inc., and its subcontractor, 
  Fortress International Group, to assist us in this review. Strategic e-Business 
  and Fortress International Group provide expertise in systems engineering and 
  critical facility infrastructure, which will allow us to evaluate SSA&#146;s 
  process for developing its overall program of requirements for the new data 
  center. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Administration&#146;s Use of Building Design Industry Best 
  Practices for its New Data Center <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To evaluate the building plans for SSA&#146;s new data center and determine 
  whether the Agency followed building design best practices to provide a data 
  center that meets SSA&#146;s requirements. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background</b><br>
  Strategic e-Business Solutions, Inc. and its subcontractor, Fortress International 
  Group, provide expertise in the areas of systems engineering and critical facility 
  infrastructure, which will allow us to evaluate SSA&#146;s use of building design 
  industry best practices. <br>
  The Social Security Administration&#146;s Use of Recovery Act Funds to Administer 
  Economic Recovery Payments <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine the appropriateness of expenses charged against the $90 million 
  made available to SSA to administer the ERPs. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA is required to identify individuals entitled to receive ERPs and provide 
  the Secretary of the Treasury with information required to disburse the payments. 
  ARRA provided up to $90 million to reimburse SSA for administrative costs incurred 
  in carrying out these responsibilities. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Improve Customer Service </b><br>
  For the past 75 years, the public has depended on SSA&#146;s programs. Whether 
  it is after the loss of a loved one, at the onset of disability, or during the 
  transition from work to retirement, SSA touches the lives of virtually every 
  person in America. The Commissioner of Social Security has acknowledged that 
  the Agency has struggled to maintain the level of service people deserve. <br>
  <br>
  SSA concedes it is at a critical time concerning its ability to deliver quality 
  customer service to the public. Many factors challenge the Agency, including 
  shifting demographics, growing workloads, changing customer expectations, and 
  an aging workforce. SSA is also finding that increasing numbers of individuals 
  expect the Agency to provide services in new ways made possible by technology. 
  Finally, SSA anticipates increases in non-traditional workloads, including new 
  provisions of the Medicare program and immigration enforcement. <br>
  As a result of the economic downturn and the leading edge of baby boomer retirements, 
  SSA is being inundated with retirement and disability claims. The Agency reported 
  in its FY 2011 Annual Performance Plan that it anticipated receiving over 3.3 
  million initial disability claims in FY 2010, over 10 percent more than in FY 
  2009, and nearly 30 percent more than in FY 2008. Additionally, nearly 80 million 
  baby boomers are expected to file for retirement over the next 20 years&#151;an 
  average of 10,000 per day. </p>
<p>To enhance customer service, SSA has focused its efforts on increasing staffing 
  levels, clarifying its correspondence, expanding the use of on-line and automated 
  services, improving telephone services, improving services provided by local 
  field offices, and integrating policy changes to complete work more efficiently. 
  While SSA has made great strides in improving service to the public, SSA acknowledges 
  increasing workloads and the loss of expertise due to the retirement of its 
  employees continues to be a challenge for the Agency. <br>
  Providing oversight to ensure representative payees properly manage Social Security 
  benefits of vulnerable beneficiaries is a critical customer service performed 
  by SSA. Some beneficiaries are not able to manage or direct the management of 
  their finances because of their youth or mental and/or physical impairment. 
  For such individuals, SSA appoints a representative payee who receives and manages 
  the beneficiary&#146;s benefit payments. As of December 2009, SSA reported there 
  were approximately 5.6 million representative payees who managed about $61 billion 
  in annual benefit payments for approximately 7.6 million beneficiaries. While 
  representative payees provide a valuable service for beneficiaries, SSA must 
  provide appropriate safeguards to ensure they meet their responsibilities to 
  the beneficiaries they serve. In addition, SSA is required to conduct periodic 
  site reviews of certain types of representative payees. Finally, if either a 
  representative payee is problematic or SSA suspects a representative payee of 
  misusing benefits, SSA may request an audit or investigation by OIG. <br>
  <br>
  As of March 2010, the Government Accountability Office had placed strategic 
  human capital management on its list of high-risk Federal programs and operations. 
  The Agency recognizes its employees are key to improving customer service. The 
  projected retirement of its employees continues to present a challenge to SSA&#146;s 
  customer service capability. About two-thirds of the Agency&#146;s 60,000 employees 
  deliver direct service to the public or directly support the services provided 
  by front-line workers. The Agency projects 50 percent of its employees, including 
  66 percent of supervisors, will be eligible to retire by FY 2018. SSA expects 
  this will result in a loss of institutional knowledge that will affect SSA&#146;s 
  ability to deliver quality service to the public. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2011, we plan to complete 19 and begin 19 reviews in this area. <br>
  <br>
  We Plan to Complete the Following Reviews in FY 2011 <br>

  Congressional Response Reports: Claimant Experiences with Disability and Retirement 
  Internet Claim Applications (2 Reviews) <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To obtain claimants&#146; perceptions on the Internet claim (iClaim) process 
  for retirement and disability benefits. <br>
  <br>
  <b> Congressional Response Reports: Disability and Retirement Internet Claim 
  Applications (2 Reviews) <br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To evaluate the iClaim application process for disability and retirement benefits. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background for 4 Reviews </b><br>
  During an April 15, 2010, House Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on 
  Social Security, hearing on SSA field office service delivery, Congressman Becerra 
  expressed interest in the OIG reviewing iClaims. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2009, SSA received more than 1.2 million retirement and disability iClaim 
  applications, which represented approximately 25 percent of all Title II applications 
  received for the year. SSA&#146;s goal is to have 50 percent of all retirement 
  claims and 25 percent of all disability claims completed on-line by FY 2012. 
  <br>
  Follow-up: Beneficiaries in Suspended Payment Status Pending the Selection of 
  a Representative Payee <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA takes appropriate actions for beneficiaries whose payments 
  have been suspended pending the selection of a representative payee. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In a May 2006 audit, we found SSA needed to improve its controls to ensure benefit 
  payments were (1) suspended only in situations that were allowed by Agency policies 
  and (2) reinstated in a timely manner. We estimated that approximately <br>
  <br>
  &#149; $4.6 million in benefits was improperly suspended and should have been 
  paid directly to about 1,700 beneficiaries; </p>
<p>&#149; $5.2 million in benefits payable to about 1,580 beneficiaries was not 
  reinstated, as required, after 1 month; and </p>
<p>&#149; $5.7 million in benefits was withheld from about 2,220 children under 
  age 15 for an average of 252 days. </p>
<p><b>Improperly Titled Bank Accounts for Beneficiaries with Representative Payees 
  and Access to Their Own Funds </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether beneficiaries who have representative payees have direct 
  access to funds in their bank accounts. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA appoints representative payees when it finds beneficiaries are incapable 
  of managing their own benefits. These representative payees receive benefits 
  on behalf of the incapable beneficiaries and use the funds to meet the beneficiaries&#146; 
  necessary expenses. <br>
  <br>
  According to SSA policy, a bank account&#146;s title must reflect the payee&#146;s 
  fiduciary interest in the funds and the beneficiary&#146;s ownership interest 
  in the funds. However, the title must not allow the beneficiary to have direct 
  access to those funds. SSA&#146;s field offices are responsible for ensuring 
  that direct deposit of benefits to representative payees is established to properly 
  titled accounts. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Minor Children Receiving Benefits Without a Representative Payee </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA is complying with its policies and procedures regarding 
  direct payment of benefits to minor children without an appointed representative 
  payee. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA generally presumes minor children under age 18 to be incapable of managing 
  their own benefit payments. However, a child age 15 to 17 may be presumed capable 
  and paid directly if certain conditions exist. SSA policy states children under 
  age 15 must have a representative payee. <br>
  Quality of Service Provided by Large Volume Organizational Representative Payees 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether organizational representative payees with large numbers 
  of SSA beneficiaries have the resources and capability to properly service the 
  beneficiaries in their care. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Previous audits have identified organizational representative payees with a 
  large number of beneficiaries that lacked the staff and expertise to provide 
  the required services. For example, 1 organizational representative payee served 
  about 500 SSA beneficiaries. However, excluding the director, the representative 
  payee had only one full-time and one part-time staff. The representative payee 
  primarily issued checks to the beneficiaries and occasionally paid some beneficiaries&#146; 
  expenses. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Quality of Service Provided Via the Social Security Administration&#146;s 
  National 800-Customer Service Telephone Number <br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA&#146;s teleservice center staff effectively serve callers 
  to its national 800-customer service telephone number. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Staff at SSA&#146;s 35 teleservice centers is responsible for answering questions; 
  performing changes of address and telephone number; processing requests for 
  direct deposit and replacement Medicare cards; and scheduling appointments with 
  local field offices for more complex issues. <br>
  Quick Response Evaluation: Threats Against Social Security Administration Employees 
  or Property <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To review SSA&#146;s process for reporting and responding to threats against 
  its employees or property. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Preventing workplace violence is a growing concern. In recent congressional 
  testimony, the Commissioner cited a growing number of threats against SSA employees. 
  SSA has an Automated Incident Reporting System for recording threats against 
  employees. The System&#146;s data indicate the number of recorded threats against 
  SSA employees and property in FY 2009 increased by more than 50 percent compared 
  to FY 2008. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Representative Payee Accounting Report Non-Responders </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA&#146;s controls are effective in ensuring organizational 
  representative payees annually account for use of beneficiary/recipient funds 
  as required. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA&#146;s Representative Payment Program provides financial management for 
  more than 7 million beneficiaries who are incapable of managing their Social 
  Security or SSI payments. Generally, SSA looks for family or friends to serve 
  in this capacity. When friends and family are not able to serve as a payee, 
  SSA looks for qualified organizations. Payees are required to report annually 
  how they spent and/or saved benefits on the beneficiary&#146;s behalf. SSA mails 
  each representative payee the accounting forms. Payees can either complete and 
  return the forms or complete the accounting report on-line. Cases where a payee 
  does not respond to the initial or second request for the annual accounting 
  report are sent to SSA field offices for follow-up. SSA data indicated that 
  from CYs 2007 through 2009, SSA referred approximately 1.9 million non-responders 
  to its field offices for resolution. If SSA is unsuccessful in obtaining an 
  accounting report, the field office should consider a change of payee. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Representative Payees for the Social Security Administration (7 Reviews) 
  </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To review organizational and individual representative payees in Alabama, the 
  District of Columbia, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, New York, and North Dakota. 
  We will determine whether these payees <br>
  &#149; have effective safeguards over the receipt and disbursement of Social 
  Security benefits; </p>
<p>&#149; ensure Social Security benefits are used and accounted for in accordance 
  with SSA&#146;s policies and procedures; and </p>
<p>&#149; adequately protect the beneficiaries&#146; personally identifiable information 
  (PII). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  A representative payee may be an individual or an organization. SSA selects 
  representative payees for Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) 
  and/or SSI beneficiaries when representative payments would serve the individual&#146;s 
  interests. Representative payees are responsible for managing benefits in the 
  best interest of the beneficiary. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Underpaid Disabled Widows </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To identify and prevent disabled widows from being underpaid. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  While identifying our population for our audit, Disability Insurance and Supplemental 
  Security Income Claims Approved in 2006 But Not Paid, we found 16 claimants 
  who should have received benefits earlier than they did. The Agency applied 
  an incorrect month of entitlement while processing these cases, which caused 
  the claimants to start receiving benefits later than they should have. The Agency 
  calculated $122,154 in past-due benefits for these 16 disabled widows. The average 
  past-due benefit was $7,635; and these past-due benefits ranged from a low of 
  $2,100 to a high of $15,557. This review will identify similarly underpaid cases 
  in SSA&#146;s records. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Improve the Timeliness and Quality of the Disability Process <br>
  </b><br>
  In April 2010, the Commissioner testified that SSA&#146;s plan is to reduce 
  the initial claims backlog to a pre-recession level by 2014. To do so, SSA developed 
  a multi-year plan that includes: <br>
  &#149; increasing staffing in the disability determination services (DDS) and 
  Federal disability processing components; </p>
<p>&#149; improving efficiency through automation; </p>
<p>&#149; expediting planned IT infrastructure investments to optimize systems 
  performance; and </p>
<p>&#149; refining policies and business processes to expedite case completion. 
</p>
<p>SSA is facing a considerable increase in initial and reconsideration claims. 
  At the end of FY 2008, there were over 565,000 initial claims pending. As of 
  June 2010, initial claims pending had grown to over 837,000, an increase of 
  48 percent over the FY 2008 year-end pending level. In addition, reconsideration 
  claim receipts through the third quarter of FY 2010 were 14 percent higher than 
  the same period in FY 2009. </p>
<p>As part of the strategy, SSA hired additional DDS employees and plans to maintain 
  higher staffing levels over the next several years. In addition, SSA is maximizing 
  the use of overtime in the DDSs. SSA also created centralized units, called 
  Extended Service Teams, in four States (Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and 
  Virginia). The Teams will assist and take claims from the States with the highest 
  pending levels. In FY 2010, SSA placed 280 new employees in the four sites. 
  SSA also increased staffing levels in the Federal disability processing components 
  that support the DDSs &#150; hiring about 237 additional employees. <br>
  <br>
  While SSA has hired additional DDS employees, some DDSs are facing high attrition 
  rates, hiring freezes, and employee furloughs, all of which impact SSA&#146;s 
  ability to process the disability workload. In our November 2009 review, Impact 
  of State Budget Issues on SSA&#146;s Disability Programs, we reported that State 
  furloughs will impact the number of disability determinations some DDSs will 
  make in FY 2010. Because of the furloughs, we expected approximately 69,000 
  cases to be delayed in processing over a 12-month period, resulting in about 
  $126.2 million in benefit payments being delayed to newly disabled claimants. 
  In July 2010, the Commissioner of Social Security announced that the Agency 
  is submitting legislation to Congress to end furloughs of federally paid, State 
  disability workers. That legislation would prohibit States, without the Commissioner&#146;s 
  prior authorization, from reducing the number of State personnel who make disability 
  determinations for Social Security or the hours they work below the amount the 
  Agency authorizes. <br>
  <br>
  The increase in initial disability applications also forces the dedication of 
  DDS resources to processing initial applications rather than conducting full 
  medical continuing disability reviews (CDR). In our March 2010 review of Full 
  Medical Continuing Disability Reviews, we reported that SSA estimates a backlog 
  of over 1.5 million full medical CDRs at the end of FY 2010. As a result, we 
  estimated that from Calendar Years (CY) 2005 through 2010, SSA will have made 
  benefit payments of between $1.3 billion and $2.6 billion that could have potentially 
  been avoided if the full medical CDRs in the backlog had been conducted by DDSs 
  when they became due. <br>
  <br>
  We will continue to work with SSA as it improves the disability process and 
  addresses the workload backlogs. We will also continue to work with SSA to address 
  the integrity of the disability programs through the Cooperative Disability 
  Investigations program. The program&#146;s mission is to obtain evidence that 
  can resolve questions of fraud in SSA&#146;s disability claims. The program 
  is managed in a cooperative effort between SSA&#146;s Offices of Operations, 
  Inspector General, and Disability Programs. <br>
  In FY 2011, we plan to complete 17 reviews and begin 23 reviews in this area. 
  <br>

  <br>
  Unnecessary Referrals to Disability Determination Services <br>
  Use of Mailer Continuing Disability Reviews <br>
  Accuracy of Quick Disability Determination Selections <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether disability claims were accurately selected as Quick Disability 
  Determinations (QDD). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  On August 1, 2006, SSA implemented the QDD process in the Boston Region. QDD 
  cases are initial disability cases that are electronically identified as (a) 
  having a high potential the claimant is disabled, (b) likely that evidence of 
  the claimant&#146;s allegations can be easily and quickly obtained, and (c) 
  a case that can be processed quickly in the DDSs. In October 2007, SSA began 
  expanding QDD beyond the Boston Region, and the national rollout was completed 
  in February 2008. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Administrative Costs Claimed by the Maine, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, and 
  South Carolina Disability Determination Services (5 Reviews) <br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To (1) evaluate the DDS&#146; internal controls over the accounting and reporting 
  of administrative costs; (2) determine whether costs claimed by the DDS were 
  allowable and funds were properly drawn; and (3) assess limited areas of the 
  general security controls environment. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Disability determinations under SSA&#146;s Disability Insurance (DI) and SSI 
  programs are performed by a DDS in each State or other responsible jurisdiction, 
  according to Federal regulations. Each DDS is responsible for determining claimants&#146; 
  disabilities and ensuring adequate evidence is available to support its determinations. 
  <br>
  <br>
  To make proper disability determinations, each DDS is authorized to purchase 
  consultative medical examinations and medical evidence of record from the claimants&#146; 
  physicians or other treating sources. SSA pays the DDS for 100 percent of allowable 
  expenditures using a State Agency Report of Obligations for SSA Disability Programs 
  (SSA Form 4513). The DDS withdraws Federal funds through the Department of the 
  Treasury&#146;s Automated Standard Application for Payments system to pay program 
  expenditures. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Disabled Individuals Hiding Self-Employment Income </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To identify individuals receiving DI benefits who may have participated in self-employment 
  activities and concealed their income by reporting it belonged to another person. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Self-employed individuals report self-employment income to the Internal Revenue 
  Service (IRS). The IRS sends self-employment income information to SSA where 
  it is recorded on an individual&#146;s earning record and used to determine 
  eligibility for retirement, survivors, disability, and health insurance benefits 
  as well as to calculate benefit amounts. <br>
  <br>
  Reporting earnings activity to the IRS under another individual&#146;s Social 
  Security number (SSN) could make an individual appear to be eligible for disability 
  benefits when he/she is not. Individuals awarded disability benefits under the 
  DI program may be inclined to conceal work by reporting their income as if it 
  belonged to someone else. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Disabled Individuals Potentially Eligible as Auxiliary Beneficiaries </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSI recipients may be eligible as auxiliary beneficiaries 
  for OASDI benefits as disabled children. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA administers the SSI and OASDI programs. The SSI program provides cash assistance 
  to individuals who have limited income and resources and who are either age 
  65 or older, blind, or disabled. The OASDI program provides benefits to qualified 
  retired and disabled workers and their dependents, and to survivors of insured 
  workers. According to SSA policy, an application for benefits under one program 
  is considered an application for all programs administered by SSA. <br>
  <br>
  Individuals receiving SSI payments with a date of disability onset before age 
  22 may be eligible for benefits as disabled children under the OASDI program 
  based on their parents&#146; entitlement to OASDI benefits or upon a parents&#146; 
  death. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Failure to Cooperate Denials and Initial Claims Backlog at the California 
  Disability Determination Services <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether the California DDS (1) incorrectly denies initial claims 
  based on failure to cooperate and (2) understates the size and age of its initial 
  claims backlog. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  An individual must provide medical evidence of impairment and how severe the 
  impairment is to establish a disability. This may include evidence of age, education, 
  training, work experience, daily activities, and any other factors that show 
  how the impairment affects the ability to work. Before a DDS can make a determination 
  concerning an individual&#146;s disability, it will develop a complete medical 
  history and make every reasonable effort to help obtain medical reports from 
  appropriate medical sources. The clamant must cooperate with the DDS to obtain 
  or identify available medical or other evidence about the impairment. When an 
  individual fails to cooperate, the DDS will make a decision based on the available 
  information. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Health Information Technology Evidence Provided by Beth Israel Deaconess 
  Medical Center and MedVirginia <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether evidence obtained through Health IT is improving SSA&#146;s 
  disability claims process. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In August 2008, SSA began piloting the Medical Evidence Gathering and Analysis 
  through Health Information Technology (MEGAHIT) prototype with Beth Israel Deaconess 
  Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. This computer process automatically 
  requests and receives electronic health records in a standardized form to support 
  SSA&#146;s disability claim decisionmaking process. MEGAHIT then analyzes the 
  data and alerts the disability examiner if the claim might be ready for adjudication. 
  According to SSA, this process occurs within a matter of minutes.<br>
  <br>
  In February 2009, SSA began working with MedVirginia in a trial implementation 
  of a system-to-system health information exchange through the Nationwide Health 
  Information Network. This is a secure Network connecting consumers, medical 
  providers, and others involved in supporting health care. SSA requests and receives 
  electronic health records through the Network. MEGAHIT then processes the electronic 
  health record data. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Indirect Costs Claimed by the New York Division of Disability Determination 
  </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether indirect costs claimed by the New York Division of Disability 
  were allowable and properly allocated. <br>
  <b><br>
  Background </b><br>
  In September 2004, we issued a report on New York&#146;s indirect costs for 
  FYs 2000 through 2002. This report stated that New York State claimed about 
  $4 million in unallowable and improperly allocated indirect costs from October 
  1999 through September 2002. We also found $1.1 million in duplicate personnel 
  costs that resulted in overcharges to claimed direct administrative costs. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Job Information Used in the Social Security Administration&#146;s Disability 
  Claims Adjudication Process <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess SSA&#146;s efforts to develop an occupational information system specifically 
  for its disability adjudication process. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In December 2008, SSA established the Occupational Information Development Advisory 
  Panel to provide advice on creating an occupational system tailored specifically 
  for SSA&#146;s disability programs. This panel delivered recommendations for 
  the content model and classification of a new occupational information system. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Overall Disability Processing Times for 2009 </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine SSA&#146;s average overall processing time for disability claims 
  decided in 2009 by DDSs, administrative law judges (ALJ), the Appeals Council, 
  and Federal Courts. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In our December 2008 report, Disability Claims Overall Processing Times, we 
  stated that disability claims in CY 2006 took (a) 131 days for cases decided 
  at the DDS level (initial claims); (b) 279 days for cases decided at the DDS 
  level (reconsiderations); (c) 811 days for cases decided at the ALJ level; (d) 
  1,053 days for cases decided at the Appeals Council level; and (e) 1,720 days 
  for cases decided at the Federal Court level. This represents the time from 
  the date of application to the date of denial or the date benefits were paid 
  if allowed (including any back payments).<br>
  <br>
  <b>Questionable Evidence from a Michigan Medical Professional </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective</b><br>
  To assess the risk to SSA&#146;s disability programs regarding the use of medical 
  evidence from a Michigan medical provider later charged with providing false 
  medical evidence to another Federal agency. Background While performing an audit 
  at the Michigan DDS, we learned of a medical professional in Dearborn, Michigan, 
  who was charged by a Federal grand jury of conspiring to defraud the United 
  States. Specifically, between 1998 and 2002, the physician falsified medical 
  evidence so non-citizens could obtain U.S. citizenship. Most of these false 
  diagnoses related to mental impairments. In May 2009, this physician pled guilty 
  to conspiring to commit naturalization fraud as part of an ongoing investigation 
  by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Impact of Furloughs on the Social Security Administration&#146;s Disability 
  Workloads in Fiscal Year 2011 </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  Evaluate the impact furloughs are having on SSA&#146;s disability programs in 
  FY 2011. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In March 2009, we issued a report, Impact of State Employee Furloughs on SSA&#146;s 
  Disability Programs. In November 2009, we issued a report, Impact of State Budget 
  Issues on SSA&#146;s Disability Programs. Our prior reviews found that furloughs 
  and other State budget issues, such as hiring freezes at the DDSs, impact SSA&#146;s 
  ability to process its disability workloads. Additionally, because fewer disability 
  decisions were made in States with furloughs, there was a negative impact on 
  the flow of money in the U.S. economy. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Social Security Administration&#146;s Plan for Reducing the Initial Claims 
  Backlog </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To evaluate the actions SSA has taken or plans to take to reduce its initial 
  claims backlog to an optimum pending level. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  At the end of FY 2008, there were 556,670 initial claims pending. However, as 
  of April 2010, there were 776,151 initial claims pending, a 39-percent increase 
  over FY 2008. Accordingly, SSA developed a multi-year strategy to achieve an 
  optimum pending level. <br>
  <br>
  The strategy will include (1) increasing staff in the DDSs and Federal processing 
  components, (2) improving efficiency through automation, (3) expediting planned 
  IT infrastructure investments, (4) expanding the use of screening tools to identify 
  likely allowances, and (5) refining policies and business processes to expedite 
  case processing. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Unpaid Allowance Decisions </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  Identify DI and SSI claims that were allowed by SSA but not paid timely. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In a prior audit, Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income Claims 
  Allowed in 2006 But Not Paid, we found 45 beneficiaries who had not been paid 
  as of 2010&#151;4 years after SSA made the decisions to pay the claimants. These 
  45 cases represent 0.004 percent of the 1.3 million allowance decisions issued 
  in 2006. This review will determine whether similar cases exist in other years.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Improve Transparency and Accountability <br>
  </b>In a January 21, 2009 memorandum on open Government to the heads of Executive 
  Departments and Agencies, the President noted that Government should be transparent 
  because transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens 
  about what their Government is doing. In FY 2011, we will report on SSA&#146;s 
  implementation of the Open Government Directive, which requires that SSA take 
  steps to make its operations more transparent, participatory, and collaborative. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Sound financial reporting and effective performance measurement support both 
  concepts of transparency and accountability. Per the Chief Financial Officers 
  Act of 1990, an audit of SSA&#146;s financial statements is overseen by the 
  OIG each year to ensure that SSA provides clear and accurate financial information 
  to the Administration, Congress, and the public. Similarly, the Government Performance 
  and Results Act requires that the Agency develop objective, quantifiable, and 
  measurable goals and outcome-based performance measures each year that are reported 
  publicly in annual performance and accountability plans and reports. The plans 
  and reports help hold the Agency accountable for achieving results, and the 
  public reporting of the Agency&#146;s progress in meeting its goals adds transparency 
  to its operations. In FY 2011, we will continue to evaluate the quality of SSA&#146;s 
  performance measures and goals to ensure they are focused on the critical programs 
  and tasks SSA needs to achieve to successfully meet its mission. <br>
  <br>
  Transparency and accountability are critical factors in the level of trust and 
  confidence the American public has in its Government, including SSA. If tax 
  dollars are not spent wisely or efficiently, the goals SSA is trying to accomplish 
  are undermined. Mismanagement and waste as well as a lack of transparency for 
  citizens into Government operations, can erode trust in SSA&#146;s ability to 
  tackle the challenges it faces. </p>
<p>Effective internal control helps ensure SSA is accountable to its mission. 
  OMB Circular A-123, Management&#146;s Responsibility for Internal Control, requires 
  that SSA develop and implement cost-effective internal controls for results-oriented 
  management. Internal control comprises the plans, methods, and procedures used 
  to meet missions, goals, and objectives. SSA management is responsible for establishing 
  and maintaining internal controls to achieve the objectives of effective and 
  efficient operations, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with applicable 
  laws and regulations. In FY 2011, we will complete a number of audits that determine 
  the effectiveness of the controls SSA has in place over its programs and systems. 
  <br>
  <br>
  As part of its efforts to be accountable, SSA must ensure that its partners 
  provide the services they are contracted to provide efficiently and effectively. 
  Each year, SSA enters into a number of contracts and provides a number of grants 
  that help SSA obtain needed services and research. In FY 2009, SSA spent over 
  $1.1 billion on contracts that provided many services, including computer system 
  development and support and Social Security Statement print and mail services. 
  We will review multiple contracts and grants in FY 2011 to ensure SSA is getting 
  the services for which it paid and has proper internal controls in place to 
  ensure effective oversight of contractors. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2011, we plan to complete 13 reviews and begin 12 reviews in this area.

  ObjectiveTo determine whether SSA is appropriately collecting backup withholding 
  taxes from vendors and reporting those taxes to the IRS. Background In 1997, 
  the IRS initiated a Tax Identification Number (TIN) matching program that agencies 
  can use to determine whether vendors have provided a correct TIN/name combination. 
  If a vendor either fails to provide a TIN or provides a TIN/name combination 
  that does not match information in IRS&#146;s records, and the endor subsequently 
  fails to provide a orrect TIN/name combination upon equest, the Federal agency 
  is required to nitiate back-up withholding of future ayments for services. Federal 
  agencies re also required to initiate back-up ithholding if instructed by the 
  IRS. The mount of back-up withholding is 8 percent of certain taxable payments.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Resource Management Inc., Indirect Cost Rate Proposal for Fiscal Year 2009 
  </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To evaluate the indirect cost rates as reported in CESSI&#146;s FY 2009 incurred 
  cost rate proposals. Specifically, we will determine whether the direct and 
  indirect costs used to develop these rates are reasonable, allowable, and allocable 
  in accordance with contract terms and applicable Government acquisition regulations. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  On December 17, 1999, the President signed Public Law 106-170, The Ticket to 
  Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999. This law established a Ticket-to-Work 
  and Self-Sufficiency Program within SSA. The Program provides employment services 
  to beneficiaries with disabilities and increases provider incentives to serve 
  these individuals. SSA awarded CESSI two contracts related to the Program. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Collection of Backup Withholding Taxes from Vendors <br>
  Congressional Response Report: The Social Security Administration's Facilities 
  Management <br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  Our objective is to provide the requested information concerning SSA&#146;s 
  facilities management. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  On August 6, 2010, Congressman Sam Johnson requested that we provide information 
  to assist the Social Security Subcommittee in determining whether SSA is strategically 
  planning its facility needs. Specifically, he requested that we provide information 
  on the following: <br>

  <b> Cost Rates Charged for the Social Security Administration&#146;s Reimbursable 
  Work for Data Exchanges <br>
  <br>
  Fiscal Year 2010 Financial Statement Audit Oversight <br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To fulfill our responsibilities under the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 
  and related legislation for ensuring the quality of the audit work performed, 
  we will monitor Grant Thornton&#146;s audit of SSA&#146;s financial statements. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 requires that agencies annually prepare 
  audited financial statements. Each agency&#146;s Inspector General is responsible 
  for auditing these financial statements to determine whether they provide a 
  fair representation of the entity&#146;s financial position. This annual audit 
  also includes an assessment of the Agency&#146;s internal control structure 
  and its compliance with laws and regulations. For FY 2010, the audit work to 
  support the opinion on SSA&#146;s financial statements will be performed by 
  Grant Thornton. We will monitor the contract to ensure the reliability of the 
  firm&#146;s work to meet our statutory requirements for auditing the Agency&#146;s 
  financial statements. <br>
  <br>
  Supporting agreements increase, the workloads of SSA&#146;s components responsible 
  for these various programs has increased. From our previous reviews of the Agency&#146;s 
  verification programs, we have found that the cost for the data exchange programs 
  vary and can range from as high as $5.00 for the Consent Based Social Security 
  Number Verification Program to $0.0062 for the Help America Vote Verification 
  Program. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective</b><br>
  To determine whether SSA is properly reimbursed by other government agencies 
  and the private sector for its data exchange services. Background Over the past 
  several years, SSA has significantly increased its electronic exchange workload. 
  The Agency has been verifying information for Federal, State, and local government 
  agencies, and with many private organizations. SSA uses various systems for 
  these data exchanges. As the number, type, and complexity of these exchange 
  programs increase and <br>

<p><b>Oversight of Contract with Grant Thornton to Perform Reviews of the Social 
  Security Administration&#146;s Cost Analysis System </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To monitor Grant Thornton&#146;s work on three reviews related to SSA&#146;s 
  Cost Analysis System (CAS). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  OIG contracted with Grant Thornton to review SSA&#146;s CAS and Cost Assignment 
  Methodology. The goals of the CAS reviews are to present recommendations for 
  enhancing SSA&#146;s use of cost accounting to improve business processes and 
  aid in management decisionmaking. <br>
  <br>
  The reviews by Grant Thornton are for the following three tasks. <br>
  1. Effectiveness of CAS - To determine the effectiveness and viability of CAS 
  as well as create a comparison between CAS and other modern cost accounting 
  systems. </p>
<p>2. CAS Data Reliability - To determine the accuracy, validity, reliability, 
  and completeness of inputs and outputs to CAS, as well as determine whether 
  the current methodology subscribes to the standards outlined in the Federal 
  Accounting Standards Advisory Board&#146;s Statement of Federal Financial Accounting 
  Standards Number 4, Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the 
  Federal Government. </p>
<p>3. SSA&#146;s Cost Assignment Methodology - To determine whether SSA has a 
  consistent, reliable, logical, and equitable method of determining the costs 
  of internal services. </p>
<p><b>Oversight of Contract with SourceLink to Mail Social Security Statements 
  </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether the contractor is using National Change of Address software 
  to update claimants&#146; mailing addresses. We will also examine the contractor&#146;s 
  quality control processes to ensure the statements delivered to the U.S. Postal 
  Service contain valid addresses. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  The Social Security Act requires that SSA provide annual statements with benefits 
  and earnings information to individuals over the age of 25 who are not yet in 
  benefit status and for whom a current mailing address can be determined. These 
  individuals must have an SSN, earnings, and a valid mailing address. <br>
  During our audit, Accuracy of Addresses on SSA&#146;s Social Security Statements, 
  we determined that during a 5-day period, approximately 166,000 Statements were 
  returned as undeliverable. To qualify for presorted discounts, mailers must 
  comply with all postal regulations, including using National Change of Address 
  software. If SSA lost the presort rate to mail earnings statements, it could 
  cost the Agency as much as $15 million more in postage per year. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Social Security Administration&#146;s Acquisition Workforce Plan </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective</b><br>
  To determine whether SSA&#146;s OAG has adhered to OMB&#146;s Acquisition Workforce 
  Development Strategic Plan for Civilian Agencies. In addition, we will determine 
  whether OAG&#146;s workforce is appropriately staffed, receiving appropriate 
  training and development, and improving its Workforce Management Infrastructure.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  As of November 2009, SSA was required to submit plans to OMB on how the Agency 
  would strengthen its acquisition workforce to ensure that contracts are awarded 
  and administered in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Our 
  review will focus on SSA&#146;s plan submitted to OMB and other actions taken 
  to adhere to the Acquisition Workforce Development Strategic Plan. We will review 
  OAG&#146;s current personnel resources, succession planning, and whether its 
  workforce has the appropriate contracting certification levels. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Work Incentives Planning and Assistance Project </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether (1) SSA has appropriate oversight and monitoring controls 
  for the Work Incentives Planning and Assistance (WIPA) project and (2) grant 
  expenditures for the WIPA project are allowable, supported, and in accordance 
  with the terms of the grant award. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Pub. L. No. 
  106-170) requires that SSA award cooperative agreements (or grants or contracts) 
  with community-based organizations called WIPA organizations to provide information 
  to disabled beneficiaries on work incentive programs and issues related to such 
  programs. There are 103 WIPA projects across the United States and U.S. Territories. 
  During grant periods 2006 through 2010, SSA awarded over $80 million to WIPA 
  grantees. <br>
  Invest in Information Technology Infrastructure to Support Current and Future 
  Workloads <br>
  <br>
  Today, SSA faces the challenge of how to best use technology to meet the Agency&#146;s 
  increasing workloads. Congress, SSA&#146;s Advisory Board, the OIG, and others 
  have concerns regarding the Agency&#146;s systems continuity and availability, 
  system modernization efforts, IT service delivery, and IT strategic planning 
  and management of IT investments. <br>
  SSA&#146;s primary IT investment over the next few years is the replacement 
  of its NCC. SSA has received over $500 million from ARRA to replace the NCC. 
  The NCC was built in 1979 and while its computing capacity has been expanded 
  over its 30 years of operations, increasing workloads and expanding telecommunication 
  services are now severely straining the NCC&#146;s ability to support the Agency&#146;s 
  business. SSA estimates that by 2012, the NCC as a stand-alone data center will 
  no longer be able to support this expanding environment. Additionally, significant 
  structural problems and electrical capacity issues have developed that now make 
  construction of a new primary computer center imperative; however, the Agency 
  has projected that this new facility cannot be operational before 2015. <br>
  <br>
  SSA took possession of the Second Support Center (SSC) in January 2009. The 
  SSC is a co-processing center, as routine operations will be divided between 
  the NCC and the SSC, each backing up data to the other on a continual basis. 
  Some of SSA&#146;s production systems began operating in the SSC in May 2009. 
  In June 2010, SSA conducted an Accelerated Disaster Recovery Environment exercise 
  to test the Agency&#146;s ability to recover completely from an NCC disaster. 
  The exercise used tapes for recovery purposes. The Accelerated Disaster Recovery 
  Environment exercise was designed to determine whether the critical systems 
  can be available at the SSC if the NCC is not available. <br>
  <br>
  In addition to its aging data center, SSA&#146;s legacy systems and applications 
  are in need of modernization. Over the past 30 years, SSA has developed some 
  of the most complex, powerful, and successful Common Object Business Oriented 
  Language (COBOL) software in the world. The Agency has roughly 60 million lines 
  of COBOL in production. These COBOL programs support the Agency&#146;s high 
  transaction volume and enable SSA to meet its regulatory, benefit, and reporting 
  requirements. <br>
  <br>
  Managing its current workloads and those projected for the future will not be 
  possible for SSA without the proper IT infrastructure. The Agency uses a variety 
  of technologies, including telephone service, the Internet, and videoconferencing 
  to deliver service to its customers. </p>
<p>However, some consider COBOL a dead or dying language. On the other hand, COBOL 
  is used in other Federal agencies and Fortune 500 companies to process billions 
  of transactions every day. In a 2007 report, the National Research Council stated 
  that newer programming languages had more productive capabilities than applications 
  written in COBOL. Further, applications in COBOL were cumbersome to maintain. 
  On the other hand, in a 2002 study, Gartner stated that replacing all SSA&#146;s 
  COBOL applications at once is too costly and risky. The study reported that 
  many of SSA&#146;s COBOL applications provide excellent, continuing support, 
  particularly for routine, high volume workloads. In conclusion, Gartner suggested 
  restructuring the COBOL applications to better support SSA&#146;s future systems 
  development. <br>
  <br>
  Historically, SSA has primarily administered its services through face-to-face 
  or telephone contact. The Agency estimated the aging of the baby boomers would 
  substantially increase its traditional workloads. To improve its services to 
  the public, the Agency has been transitioning to Web-based services for both 
  retirement and disability claims. The Agency took its first step toward this 
  transition by introducing the Internet Social Security Benefit Application in 
  2000, and by the end of 2007, SSA offered 17 eServices to the public. While 
  SSA offers web-based services, currently, only 35 percent of retirement applications 
  are filed by the public on-line. The Commissioner testified that to keep SSA&#146;s 
  field offices from being overwhelmed by increasing workloads, the Agency would 
  need to increase electronic filings to 50 percent by 2013. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2008, SSA&#146;s 800-number network handled about 58 million calls. Call 
  volumes are estimated to reach 68 million by 2010 and have surpassed the Agency&#146;s 
  ability to keep pace with its workloads. One way SSA is addressing this need 
  is through the use of Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) telephone systems. 
  VOIP places telephone calls through the Internet, which allows SSA to fully 
  integrate its telephone system and computer network. Thus, VOIP provides faster 
  call routing to any geographic location, the ability for calls to follow the 
  users between locations across the network, and quicker access to caller information. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In our 2010 review, The Social Security Administration&#146;s Voice Over Internet 
  Protocol Contract (A-14-09-19045), we contacted several field offices where 
  VOIP had been installed and they had experienced service issues. For example, 
  we encountered long wait times, disconnected or dropped calls, poor sound quality, 
  and difficulty when navigating the telephone menu tree. If our experiences are 
  representative of VOIP functionality, this raises concerns about the level of 
  customer service provided to individuals calling SSA&#146;s field offices. <br>
  In FY 2011, we plan to complete 10 reviews and begin 10 reviews in this area

  <b>Controls over the Social Security Number Application Process </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To assess controls over SSA&#146;s Social Security Number Application Process 
  (SSNAP). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA employees previously used two systems to process SSN card requests. The 
  SSNAP initiative combined the functionality from the two systems into a single 
  Web-based application. As of February 1, 2010, SSNAP was fully implemented in 
  all SSA regions to process original and replacement Social Security cards. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Electronic Claims Analysis Tool </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To assess the national rollout of SSA&#146;s Electronic Claims Analysis Tool 
  (eCAT). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In 2005, SSA began the development of eCAT to document the analysis made by 
  a DDS employee at each step in the disability adjudication process. The eCAT 
  was designed to <br>
  <br>
  &#149; provide a comprehensive claim determination/decision rationale at each 
  respective adjudicative level; </p>
<p>&#149; capture data for re-use and analysis at/between all levels of case adjudication; 
</p>
<p>&#149; capture management information at each decisional step; </p>
<p>&#149; integrate with quality initiatives; </p>
<p>&#149; provide training efficiencies; and </p>
<p>&#149; provide consistency and conformity in rationale format and documentation. 
</p>
<p>In 2006, SSA released eCAT on a limited basis and has gradually expanded its 
  use while increasing its functionality. SSA expects to complete the national 
  rollout by April 2011. <br>
  Fiscal Year 2010 Evaluation of the Social Security Administration&#146;s Compliance 
  with the Federal Information Security Management Act <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA&#146;s overall security program and practices complied 
  with the requirements of the Federal Information Security Management Act of 
  2002 (FISMA) in FY 2010. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  FISMA provides the framework for securing the Government&#146;s information 
  and information systems. All agencies must implement the requirements of FISMA 
  and report annually to OMB and Congress on the adequacy and effectiveness of 
  their security programs. FISMA requires that each agency develop, document, 
  and implement an agency-wide information security program. <br>
  <br>
  OMB uses information reported pursuant to FISMA to evaluate agency-specific 
  and Government-wide security performance, develop the annual security report 
  to Congress, and assist in improving and maintaining adequate agency security 
  performance. On April 21, 2010, OMB issued FISMA reporting instructions. <br>
  <br>
  Follow-up: Personally Identifiable Information Made Available to the General 
  Public Via the Death Master File <br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine the extent to which publication of the Death Master File (DMF) 
  results in a breach of PII. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In our June 2008 report, we determined that SSA&#146;s publication of the DMF 
  resulted in the breach of PII for more than 20,000 living individuals erroneously 
  listed as deceased on the DMF. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 Badging Process </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To assess the internal controls over the distribution of Agency badges to contractor 
  personnel. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 requires that all Federal agencies 
  develop a common identification process for Agency personnel and contractor 
  employees. SSA compliance with this directive required the issuance of nearly 
  100,000 compliant identification badges and the installation of appropriate 
  hardware and supporting software systems for all points of physical access to 
  every SSA facility. <br>
  <br>
  To comply with this Directive, SSA created an electronic system, the Identity 
  Management System, to store required information and interface with other SSA 
  systems. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Social Security Administration&#146;s Agency-wide Support Services Contract 
  with Lockheed Martin <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To (1) ensure SSA received the goods and services for which it contracted and 
  (2) review the services provided by Lockheed Martin and related costs charged 
  to SSA for adherence to the negotiated contract terms and applicable regulations. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA contracted with Lockheed Martin to supplement existing staff with specialized 
  technical skills needed for the Agency to achieve its strategic goals. The Agency&#146;s 
  strategic goals are to eliminate the hearings backlog and prevent its recurrence; 
  improve the speed and quality of the disability process; and improve retiree 
  and other core services. The contract total award amount is $493 million (of 
  which about $2 million is from ARRA funds). This contract provides support for 
  a wide range of Agency strategic initiatives, projects, and functions. The contract 
  was awarded through September 30, 2011, with 6 option years. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Social Security Administration&#146;s E-Authentication Process <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA&#146;s e-authentication process creates a strong, secure 
  protocol that meets Federal guidelines and standards. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA is implementing more robust Internet services that will feature on-line 
  exchange of information. The Agency collects information from users, such as 
  earnings data, employment history, and other sensitive information. Such services 
  carry a risk of inappropriate disclosure. The Agency has researched e-authentication 
  solutions for its automated services. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Social Security Administration&#146;s Managing and Monitoring of Local 
  Profiles <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA&#146;s management and monitoring of non-financially 
  significant profiles compromises the security of its information, information 
  systems, personnel, or other resources, operations, or assets. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  During our FY 2009 financial statement audit, we identified approximately 3,650 
  local profiles. Initially, we identified 101 of those local profiles as having 
  access to financially significant applications. Based on the analysis of additional 
  information received from SSA, we found that the Agency had not properly managed 
  and monitored 91 local profiles. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Social Security Administration&#146;s Post-Implementation Review of Internet 
  Claims <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA performed its post-implementation review of iClaim 
  in accordance with Federal guidelines, standards, and best practices. In addition, 
  we will assess the functionality and security of the iClaim application. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  OMB defines a post-implementation review as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the 
  overall effectiveness of an agency&#146;s capital planning and acquisition process. 
  The iClaim application was designed to be user-friendly and shorten the time 
  it takes to file an online application. SSA performed an iClaim post-implementation 
  review in 2009. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Voice Over Internet Protocol&#146;s Impact on Field Office Telephone Service 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine the impact of VOIP on customer service in SSA&#146;s field offices. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  VOIP is the delivery of voice communications over certain networks, such as 
  the Internet. VOIP will allow SSA to fully integrate its telephone systems and 
  computer network to provide a consolidated communications platform. <br>
  <br>
  During our 2010 review, The Social Security Administration&#146;s Voice Over 
  Internet Protocol Contract, we found long wait times, disconnected or dropped 
  calls, poor sound quality, and difficulty when navigating the telephone menu 
  tree. We are concerned that VOIP may be impacting customer service. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Reduce Improper Payments and Increase Overpayment Recoveries </b><br>
  <br>
  Workers, employers, and taxpayers who fund the SSA and SSI programs deserve 
  to have their tax dollars effectively managed. As a result, SSA must be a responsible 
  steward of the funds entrusted to its care and minimize the risk of making improper 
  payments. SSA strives to balance its service commitments to the public with 
  its stewardship responsibilities. However, given the size and complexity of 
  the programs the Agency administers, some payment errors will occur. <br>
  <br>
  For example, according to SSA, in FY 2008, <br>
  &#149; SSI overpayments were $4.6 billion (10.3 percent of outlays) and underpayments 
  were $789 million (or 1.8 percent of outlays). </p>
<p>&#149; DI overpayments were $1.2 billion (1.12 percent of outlays) and underpayments 
  were $160 million (or 0.15 percent of outlays). </p>
<p>&#149; OASI overpayments were $841 million (0.17 percent of outlays) and underpayments 
  were $334 million (or 0.07 percent of outlays). </p>
<p>SSA is responsible for issuing over $700 billion in benefit payments annually 
  to about 60 million people. Given the large overall dollars involved in SSA&#146;s 
  payments, even the slightest error in the overall process can result in millions 
  of dollars in over- or underpayments. </p>
<p>For FYs 2009 to 2012, SSA&#146;s goal is to maintain OASDI payment accuracy 
  at 99.8 percent for both over- and underpayments; whereas for SSI, the Agency&#146;s 
  goal is to achieve an underpayment accuracy rate of 98.8 percent and an overpayment 
  accuracy rate of 96 percent. <br>
  <br>
  In November 2009, the President issued Executive Order 13520 on reducing improper 
  payments; and in March 2010, OMB issued guidance for implementing it. Also, 
  in July 2010, the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 was 
  enacted. As a result, all agencies with high-priority programs&#151;because 
  they have significant improper payments&#151;are required to intensify their 
  efforts to eliminate payment errors. SSA&#146;s programs are designated as high 
  risk. <br>
  <br>
  The reduction of improper payments is one of SSA&#146;s key strategic objectives. 
  A powerful tool for reducing improper payments is the CDR. Through completion 
  of CDRs, SSA periodically verifies that individuals are still disabled and entitled 
  to disability payments. Available data indicate that SSA saves about $10 for 
  every $1 spent on CDRs. However, the Agency has cut back on this workload over 
  the past several years. From CY 2005 through CY 2010, we estimate SSA will make 
  between $1.3 and $2.6 billion in disability benefit payments that could potentially 
  have been avoided if full medical CDRs were conducted when they became due. 
  Furthermore, although SSA plans to conduct an increased number of full medical 
  CDRs in FY 2011, a backlog of approximately 1.5 million full medical CDRs will 
  most likely remain. Therefore, we estimate SSA will pay between $556 million 
  and $1.1 billion during CY 2011 that could have been avoided if the full medical 
  CDRs were conducted when they became due. <br>
  <br>
  Similarly, SSA decreased the number of SSI redeterminations conducted between 
  FYs 2003 and 2009 by more than 40 percent. We estimated in a July 2009 report, 
  Supplemental Security Income Redeterminations, that SSA could have saved an 
  additional $3.3 billion during FYs 2008 and 2009 by conducting redeterminations 
  at the same level it did in FY 2003. <br>
  SSA has identified the major causes of improper payments and has taken steps 
  to address them. For example, one of the major causes of improper payments in 
  the OASDI program is benefit computation errors. SSA developed automated tools 
  to address the more troublesome computation issues. Another major cause of improper 
  payments in the SSI program is the failure of a recipient or representative 
  payee to provide accurate and timely reports of new or increased wages. In response, 
  SSA developed a large-scale monthly wage reporting system incorporating touch-tone 
  and voice recognition telephone technology. SSA also uses the Access to Financial 
  Institutions to reduce SSI payment errors by identifying undisclosed financial 
  accounts with balances that place recipients over the SSI resource limit. SSA 
  plans to expand the use of this process in the future. <br>
  <br>
  SSA uses a variety of methods to collect the debt related to overpayments. Collection 
  techniques include internal methods, such as benefit withholding and billing 
  and follow-up. In addition, SSA uses external collection techniques authorized 
  by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (Pub L. No. 104-134) for OASDI 
  debts and the Foster Care Independence Act of 1999 (Pub. L. No. 106-169) for 
  SSI debts. These debt collection tools include the Treasury Offset Program, 
  credit bureau reporting, administrative wage garnishment and Federal Salary 
  Offset. In FY 2009, SSA recovered $3.06 billion in improper payments at an administrative 
  cost of $0.06 for every dollar collected. According to SSA, the Agency began 
  developing several debt collection enhancements in FY 2010, and it will continue 
  to improve its debt collection program. <br>
  <br>
  SSA has also worked to improve its ability to prevent over- and underpayments 
  by implementing our audit recommendations. For example, in June 2010, we issued 
  a report, Manual Computations of Supplemental Security Income Payments, which 
  identified about $4.4 million in overpayments and about $3.7 million in underpayments 
  for the period July 2008 through June 2009. SSA agreed with the recommendations 
  we made to improve this area and had already initiated actions to correct the 
  payment errors identified. <br>
  <br>
  We also issued a report in July 2010, Retroactive Title II Payments to Released 
  Prisoners, where we estimated SSA issued approximately $3.8 million in retroactive 
  payments that released prisoners were not entitled to receive. SSA agreed with 
  our recommendations. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2011, we plan to complete 30 reviews and begin 25 reviews in this area.

  <b>Accuracy of Fiscal Year 2009 Title II Disability Insurance Benefit Payments 
  Involving Workers&#146; Compensation Offset <br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA accurately offset Title II benefits on FY 2009 DI claims 
  that involved State Workers&#146; Compensation (WC) benefits. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Workers injured on the job may qualify for DI benefits in addition to benefits 
  received from Federal, State, and other WC programs. However, the combined DI 
  and WC benefits could result in workers receiving more in disability payments 
  than they earned before they became disabled. To prevent this, Congress enacted 
  the WC offset provision, which requires that SSA reduce DI payments by the amount 
  of other disability benefits received from State or Federal WC, as well as Public 
  Disability Benefits. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Accuracy of Survivor Benefit Payments Issued Through the Social Security 
  Administration&#146;s Manual Adjustment, Credit and Award Process System <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine the payment accuracy of survivor benefit payments issued through 
  SSA&#146;s Manual Adjustment, Credit and Award Process system. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In certain situations, SSA&#146;s automated systems cannot completely process 
  a survivor&#146;s benefit action. Our April 2006 review, Payments Resulting 
  from Disability Insurance Actions Processed via the Social Security Administration's 
  Manual Adjustment, Credit and Award Processes, found that disabled beneficiaries 
  had payment errors of about $19.7 million. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Administrative Waivers Granted When a Beneficiary&#146;s Liability Balance 
  Totals More Than $1,000 <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine the number of beneficiaries who received administrative waivers 
  when their outstanding liability balance was greater than the $1,000 threshold. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Beginning on October 15, 2008, SSA raised the limit to $1,000 for when overpayment 
  recovery can be waived unless there is some indication that the beneficiary 
  may be at fault in causing the overpayment. <br>
  <br>
  Policy states that if a person is liable for several overpayments that total 
  over $1,000, even though each is under $1,000, the overpayments cannot be waived. 
  <br>
</p>
<p><b>Aged Beneficiaries Whose Benefits Have Been Suspended for Address or Whereabouts 
  Unknown Reasons <br>
  </b><br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA has taken appropriate actions for aged beneficiaries 
  whose benefits were suspended for address or whereabouts unknown reasons. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Third-party reports, mail, and undeliverable checks may indicate that a beneficiary&#146;s 
  whereabouts are unknown. Suspension of benefits is proper when SSA cannot locate 
  beneficiaries and their whereabouts are unknown. SSA staff is required to document 
  any efforts to locate the beneficiary. When benefits have been suspended for 
  whereabouts unknown for a period of at least 7 continuous years, SSA assumes 
  the beneficiary is deceased and terminates entitlement to benefits effective 
  with the date the beneficiary disappeared. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Benefits Withheld from Deceased Beneficiaries that Are Payable to Survivors 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA is taking appropriate action to identify and pay surviving 
  beneficiaries previously withheld payments of deceased beneficiaries <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA may suspend benefits when it receives a report that a beneficiary&#146;s 
  whereabouts are unknown or if benefit checks are undeliverable. SSA may also 
  temporarily suspend benefits pending selection of a representative payee. When 
  this occurs, the field offices must take appropriate actions and reinstate benefits. 
  If a beneficiary dies before SSA reinstates benefits, any previously withheld 
  benefits should be paid to surviving beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Concurrent Beneficiaries Receiving Supplemental Security Income Payments 
  in Excess of the Federal Benefit Rate <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether concurrent beneficiaries received SSI payments that, when 
  combined with their OASDI benefits, exceeded the Federal benefit rate. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Our 2009 report, Supplemental Security Income Overpayments to Concurrent Beneficiaries 
  Resulting from Incorrect Benefit Calculations, estimated that SSA issued overpayments 
  to approximately 6,800 concurrently entitled beneficiaries as the result of 
  an SSI unearned income computation error. The recipients were overpaid because 
  SSA erroneously offset their SSI payments using OASDI benefit amounts that were 
  not adjusted to reflect benefit payment increases. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Data Match of the Social Security Administration&#146;s Disability Insurance 
  Records with Ohio&#146;s Workers&#146; Compensation Payment Data <br>
  <br>
  Objective</b><br>
  To determine whether the WC data SSA used to process DI claims for workers injured 
  in Ohio, agreed with Ohio&#146;s WC payment data. Background Workers injured 
  on the job may qualify for DI benefits in addition to benefits under Federal 
  and State WC programs. However, combined DI and WC benefits could result in 
  workers receiving more in disability payments than they earned before they became 
  disabled. To prevent this, Congress enacted the WC offset provision that requires 
  that SSA reduce DI payments <br>
  by the amount of any other disability benefit paid under any law or plan of 
  the United States, a State, or a political subdivision. <br>
  <br>
  The State of Ohio maintains an electronic data base of its WC payment data. 
  This data can be matched against SSA information to determine whether the correct 
  amount of DI benefits were paid. <br>
  <b><br>
  Debt Collection Activities for the Supplemental Security Income Program <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To identify the potential financial impact if SSA performed additional debt 
  collection activities for SSI overpayments. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  The 2008 Annual Report of the Supplemental Security Income Program states, &quot;Just 
  as the decreased stewardship focus has increased SSI overpayments, efforts to 
  maintain frontline services have also eroded SSA&#146;s ability to collect this 
  debt. In spite of advancements in systems and methods used to collect overpayments&#133;lessened 
  funding of SSI&#146;s debt collection activity has led to decreased percentages 
  of debt in payment arrangements.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Since FY 2002, SSA&#146;s percentage of outstanding SSI debt in a collection 
  arrangement has been in decline. Specifically, between FYs 2002 and 2009, the 
  percentage of outstanding SSI debt in a collection arrangement fell from 55.4 
  percent to 49.9 percent. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Development of Supplemental Security Income Wage Alerts and Diaries <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine the effectiveness of SSA&#146;s development of SSI wage alerts 
  and diaries. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Agency staff receives an alert when the State wage amount for an SSI recipient 
  exceeds SSA&#146;s recorded wage amount by $250 or more in a quarter. SSA staff 
  also receives a diary to take action when the annual wage report for an SSI 
  recipient is $1,000 or more higher than the amount that was used to calculate 
  the recipient&#146;s SSI payment. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Follow-up: Accuracy of the Garnishment of Title II Benefits by the Social 
  Security Administration&#146;s Court Order Garnishment System <br>
  <br>
  Objective</b><br>
  The objectives of our review are to determine whether SSA&#146;s Court Ordered 
  Garnishment System (COGS) accurately (1) calculates the allowable garnishment 
  amounts and (2) documents all new, amended, and terminated garnishment orders 
  in a retrieval system for later access. Background OASDI benefits are subject 
  to legal proceedings brought by a State Agency or individual to enforce a legal 
  obligation of a beneficiary to provide child support and/or make alimony payments. 
  COGS is SSA&#146;s system that automates many of the tasks associated with withholding 
  from beneficiaries in compliance with State- or court-ordered garnishment requests. 
  For example, COGS tracks payments and court orders; <br>
  deducts the garnishment from the beneficiary&#146;s payment; issues the payment 
  to the court, child support agency, or ex-spouse; and sends the appropriate 
  <br>
  As of March 2006, approximately 180,000 beneficiaries with garnishments were 
  converted from the manual garnishment system to the automated COGS. These converted 
  cases have a default start date in COGS of March 6, 2006. The garnishment amounts 
  included in COGS were the previous amounts in the manual garnishment system. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Follow-up: Controls over Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance Replacement 
  Checks for Beneficiaries Who Previously Double Negotiated Benefit Checks <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine the effectiveness of SSA&#146;s controls over the OASDI replacement 
  check process for beneficiaries who had previously negotiated multiple benefit 
  checks. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  If an individual is overpaid for cashing both an original and replacement check, 
  SSA should not issue an immediate replacement if another non-receipt is claimed 
  in the following 2 years; instead they should wait to determine whether the 
  original check was cashed. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Follow-up: Individuals Receiving Benefits Inappropriately Under Multiple 
  Social Security Numbers <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To identify and prevent individuals from receiving OASDI benefits and/or SSI 
  payments inappropriately under multiple SSNs. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In FY 2005, we issued a report, Individuals Receiving Benefits under Multiple 
  Social Security Numbers, which identified almost $9.2 million in benefits inappropriately 
  paid to 220 beneficiaries with multiple SSNs. Our FY 2006 review, Beneficiaries 
  Paid Under More Than One Social Security Number, found 212 cases involving possible 
  fraud and 9 with administrative errors. As of July 2006, SSA had identified 
  $3 million in overpayments for these cases. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Follow-up: Social Security Funds Held in Dormant Bank Accounts <br>
  <br>
  Objective</b><br>
  To determine the effectiveness of the Agency&#146;s efforts to collect SSA funds 
  held in dormant bank accounts. Background Our February 2004 audit, Social Security 
  Funds held in Dormant Bank Accounts, reviewed 15 beneficiaries who were presumed 
  dead and had $1.3 million in SSA funds in dormant bank accounts. The funds accumulated 
  in the bank accounts after the presumed date of death because of the continuing 
  of direct deposit benefit payments. We looked at these same 15 beneficiaries 
  in December 2009 and SSA still had not determined a date of death in most cases 
  and had not collected the funds in the dormant bank accounts. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Follow-up: Supplemental Security Income Overpayments to Recipients in Title 
  XIX Institutions <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To (1) determine the status of corrective actions SSA has taken to address recommendations 
  in our June 2006 report, Supplemental Security Income Overpayments to Recipients 
  in Title XIX Institutions, and (2) assess overpayments to SSI recipients living 
  in Title XIX institutions. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Residence in a Title XIX institution, such as a nursing home or other long-term 
  care facility, can affect an SSI recipient&#146;s eligibility and/or payment 
  amount. <br>
  Our June 2006 audit determined that SSA continued to overpay recipients in such 
  institutions millions of dollars each year and did not collect most of the overpayments. 
  SSA&#146;s ability to prevent these overpayments was diminished because some 
  recipients or representative payees did not report changes in living arrangements, 
  and the institutions did not routinely report SSI recipients&#146; admissions. 
  Further, SSA personnel did not promptly process alerts that identified SSI recipients&#146; 
  admissions to nursing homes. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Follow-up: Survivor Benefits Paid in Instances When the Social Security Administration 
  Removed the Death Entry from a Primary Wage Earner&#146;s Record <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA took effective action in response to our September 
  2006 report, Survivor Benefits Paid in Instances When the Social Security Administration 
  Removed the Death Entry from a Primary Wage Earner&#146;s Record. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Our 2006 report identified 307 wage earners whose family members received survivor 
  benefits even though SSA removed the wage earners&#146; death entries from the 
  DMF, and SSA&#146;s records indicated the wage earners were alive. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Implementation of the Martinez Settlement Agreement <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess SSA&#146;s implementation of the Martinez settlement agreement. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  In September 2009, a U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California 
  approved a class action settlement agreement (Martinez v. Astrue) that reduced 
  the number and type of felony warrants SSA uses to prohibit payment of OASDI 
  and SSI benefits. The settlement agreement also provided for retroactive payments. 
  <br>
  SSA planned to implement the settlement agreement and issue retroactive payments 
  in four phases. SSA estimated that the Martinez settlement would cost the Agency 
  about $693 million to restore benefits and/or eliminate overpayments to fugitive 
  felons. <br>
  <b><br>
  Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Benefits Affected by Government 
  Pensions <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To identify OASDI beneficiaries whose payments may be affected by State or local 
  government pensions. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  The OASDI program provides monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers and 
  their families and to survivors of deceased workers. An individual may be eligible 
  for benefits under his or her own work history as well as under a spouse&#146;s 
  work history. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Act contains two provisions that reduce the monthly benefits 
  paid to individuals who also receive a pension based on Federal, State, or local 
  government employment not covered by Social Security&#151;Windfall Elimination 
  Provision and Government Pension Offset. The Windfall Elimination Provision 
  eliminates &#147;windfall&#148; Social Security benefits for retired and disabled 
  workers receiving pensions from employment not covered by Social Security. Government 
  Pension Offset reduces monthly Social Security benefits for spouses, divorced 
  spouses, and surviving spouses who receive a pension payment based on their 
  own work for a Federal, State, or local government that was not subject to Social 
  Security taxes. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Processing of Internal Revenue Service Alerts <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA is properly processing the IRS&#146; 1099 alerts and 
  adjusting benefit amounts appropriately. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA must adjust SSI payments accordingly when there are changes in a recipient&#146;s 
  income or resources. The Tax Reform Act of 1984 provides for SSA to receive 
  financial information from the IRS to help detect unreported nonwage information, 
  such as pensions, interest, and dividends. When IRS records indicate possible 
  income or resources not reported on their SSI records, an alert is generated. 
  SSA staff is required to verify the information with the recipient or the financial 
  institution and adjust or terminate the benefits if warranted. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Quick Response Evaluation: The Social Security Administration&#146;s Interim 
  Assistance Reimbursement Sample Reviews <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess the extent to which SSA conducts Interim Assistance Reimbursement 
  sample reviews. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Many SSI applicants need financial aid before SSA can establish eligibility. 
  As a result, States may enter into an agreement with SSA to provide individuals 
  interim assistance paid from state funds. Upon determining the applicant&#146;s 
  eligibility for SSI, the Agency reimburses the State or local government for 
  payments made to recipients using State funds. <br>
  <br>
  Currently, 38 states and the District of Columbia participate in this program. 
  SSA policy requires each regional office to conduct a &#147;sample review&#148; 
  of the States&#146; accounting records of monthly interim assistance reimbursement 
  payments. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Streamlining of the Medicare Non-Usage Project <br>
  <br>
  Objective</b><br>
  To determine whether the Medicare Non-Usage Project can be enhanced through 
  matching SSA beneficiary records with databases containing information on Health 
  Maintenance Organizations, private insurance use, and nursing facility admissions. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA has conducted two Medicare Non-Usage Projects using data matches with the 
  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to determine whether Title II beneficiaries 
  over age 90 had used Medicare in the previous 3 years. SSA recovered millions 
  of dollars from these projects, but only about 5 percent of the targeted individuals 
  were deceased or could not be located. Many of the remaining 95 percent were 
  alive, but data matches did not detect this because they were using private 
  insurance or Health Maintenance Organizations rather than Medicare. Others were 
  in nursing facilities and presumably using Medicaid. Because of the costs and 
  time involved in trying to contact these individuals, SSA suspended the Project. 
  <br>
  Since the last Project, Medicare&#146;s databases have been enhanced and are 
  now more comprehensive. In this review, we plan to remove the majority of beneficiaries 
  who are alive, thereby reducing the project&#146;s time and cost factors. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Supplemental Security Income Double Check Negotiations<br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether actions taken by SSA to reduce double-check negotiations 
  were effective. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  We issued a September 2003 report, Controls over Supplemental Security Income 
  Replacement Checks, and a September 2006 report, Follow-up Review of Controls 
  over <br>
  <br>
  <b>Supplemental Security Income Replacement Checks. </b><br>
  <br>
  The 2003 audit estimated that SSA could realize about $137.5 million in program 
  savings over a 5-year period if it took action to deter individuals from initiating 
  multiple double check negotiations and recovered related overpayments timely. 
  Our 2006 review disclosed that SSA had implemented corrective actions to address 
  the recommendations in our 2003 report. While SSA had taken corrective action, 
  we found that the Agency would benefit by taking additional steps to prevent 
  and recover double check negotiation overpayments. <br>
  <b><br>
  Supplemental Security Income Recipients Who Allege Being Separated or Divorced 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective</b><br>
  To assess the living arrangements of SSI recipients who allege being separated 
  or divorced and determine the effect of such allegations on SSI payments. Background 
  As of January 2010, the Federal benefit rate was $674 for individuals and $1,011 
  for couples. In addition, SSI payments are dependent, in part, on the amount 
  of income available to individuals. As such, spouses&#146; income may reduce 
  or eliminate individuals&#146; SSI payments. A benefit rate for married couples 
  that is lower than that for two individuals who live together, may provide an 
  incentive for recipients to falsely report their living arrangements. To receive 
  higher benefits, couples may say they have separated or divorced when, in fact, 
  they are still living together. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Supplemental Security Income Recipients with Frequent Overpayments <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine the causes for SSI recipients who frequently receive SSI overpayments. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  As outlined in the Social Security Advisory Board Issue Brief Number 4 A Look 
  Back at the Last 10 Years of SSI Program Integrity, SSI overpayments have increased 
  since 1999. The Issue Brief states that many SSI recipients who receive overpayments 
  did so, in part, because they did not know the program rules or reporting was 
  too difficult. Over the past 6 years, SSI overpayments have increased from just 
  over $2 billion in FY 2003 to almost $5 billion in FY 2008. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Social Security Administration&#146;s Plan to Reduce Improper Payments 
  under Executive Order 13520 for Fiscal Year 2011 <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To review the Accountable Official&#146;s Annual Report submitted in March 2011, 
  as required by Executive Order 13520 on reducing improper payments, and determine 
  whether (1) the figures presented are accurate, and (2) the Agency complied 
  with all requirements of the Executive Order. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  On November 20, 2009, the President issued Executive Order 13520, Reducing Improper 
  Payments and Eliminating Waste in Federal Programs, to reduce improper payments 
  by intensifying efforts to eliminate payment error, waste, fraud, and abuse 
  in the major programs administered by the Government, while continuing to ensure 
  that Federal programs serve and provide access to their intended beneficiaries. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Under the order, SSA is to provide the OIG a report containing the Agency&#146;s: 
  <br>
  &#149; methodology for identifying and measuring improper payments by high-priority 
  program; </p>
<p>&#149; plan for meeting the reduction targets for improper payments in the 
  high-priority programs, and </p>
<p>&#149; plan for ensuring the initiatives undertaken pursuant to the order do 
  not unduly burden program access and participation by eligible beneficiaries. 
</p>
<p><b>The Social Security Administration&#146;s Collection of Civil Monetary Penalties 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA collects civil monetary penalties once they are imposed 
  by the OIG. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  The use of civil monetary penalties went into effect on October 1, 1994. The 
  Commissioner of Social Security delegated the authority to impose these penalties 
  to the OIG. The OIG may impose a penalty against any person whom it determines 
  (1) made or knew that a statement being made was false, lacked material fact, 
  or was a disregard for the truth or (2) misused certain Social Security program 
  words, letters, symbols, and emblems. <br>
  <br>
  Once a determination becomes final, collection of the civil monetary penalties 
  should be at 100 percent. Collection may be deducted from ongoing benefits, 
  a person&#146;s tax refund, or any combination thereof. In addition, SSA may 
  use the collection authorities provided under the Debt Collection Act of 1982. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Title II Alien Nonpayment Provisions <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess the impact of the alien nonpayment provisions on SSA field offices 
  along the Mexican border. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Under the Social Security Act, OASDI benefits are withheld for otherwise eligible 
  noncitizens when they are outside the United States. However, there are several 
  exceptions to that rule, and in practice, citizens of many countries can meet 
  one or more of those exceptions. A noncitizen beneficiary who does not meet 
  an exception becomes ineligible after being outside the United States for 6 
  full calendar months. However, if the beneficiary establishes presence in the 
  United States at least once every 30 days, the 6-month period will never begin, 
  and payment can continue indefinitely. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Title II Beneficiaries Whose Benefits Have Been Suspended and Have a Date 
  of Death on the Numident <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To evaluate SSA&#146;s controls over reported deaths for beneficiaries whose 
  benefits are suspended. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  When SSA receives a report that a beneficiary is deceased, benefits are suspended 
  pending development. SSA staff is required to verify the month and year of death 
  and terminate benefits accordingly. If the beneficiary is alive benefits are 
  resumed effective with the first month of suspension. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Title XVI Hearing Applicants with Earnings after Disability Onset <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether earnings after an alleged disability onset are taken into 
  account before making hearing decisions. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  We identified at least 13,000 individuals receiving SSI payments who had earnings 
  after their date of disability onset, but before an ALJ issued a favorable disability 
  decision. While claimants may work between the date they applied for disability 
  benefits and the date they receive a final decision, their work history, especially 
  if it was above allowable levels, should be considered by an ALJ when making 
  his or her decision. <br>
  <b><br>
  Underpayments Payable under the Annual Earnings Test Provisions <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether the Agency correctly pays individuals whose self-reported 
  earnings exceeds the earnings on SSA&#146;s Master Earnings File (MEF). <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Social Security benefits are intended to replace, in part, earnings an individual 
  or family loses because of retirement, disability, or death. Title II of the 
  Social Security Act requires that SSA use an annual earnings test to measure 
  the extent of beneficiaries&#146; retirement and determine the amount to be 
  deducted from their monthly benefits. <br>
  Prior audit work has disclosed that SSA did not process the records of beneficiaries 
  whose annual earnings report was higher than the amount posted to the MEF. SSA 
  accepted the earnings reported by the beneficiary instead of processing the 
  records through its Earnings Enforcement Operation and determining the cause 
  of the discrepant data. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Unprocessed Supplemental Security Income Windfall Offsets <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA has taken proper action to process SSI windfall offsets 
  and issue any Title II benefits withheld in a timely manner. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  When beneficiaries are entitled to both OASDI and SSI for the same months, any 
  retroactive OASDI benefits that may be payable must be reduced by any SSI payments 
  that should not have been paid because of the OASDI entitlement. <br>
  <br>
  In potential offset cases, when an OASDI claim is processed, past due benefits 
  are withheld pending an SSI offset computation. The offset determination is 
  controlled by a follow-up diary and alert to ensure the offset is processed. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Reduce the Hearings Backlog and Prevent Its Recurrence </b><br>
  <br>
  Since May 2007, the Agency has been implementing the Commissioner&#146;s plan 
  to eliminate the backlog of hearing requests and prevent its recurrence. The 
  Commissioner&#146;s plan focuses on (1) compassionate allowances, (2) improving 
  hearing office procedures, (3) increasing adjudicatory capacity, and (4) increasing 
  efficiency with automation and improved business processes. The Agency&#146;s 
  goal is to eliminate the hearings backlog by 2013 and improve average processing 
  time to 270 days. Achieving these goals will depend on a number of factors, 
  including available resources and expected workloads. For example, the additional 
  resources provided under ARRA for FYs 2009 and 2010 allowed the Agency to hire 
  more ALJ and support staff to process hearing requests. As a result, the Agency 
  is making progress in this area. In March 2010, the Commissioner announced that 
  the number of pending hearings was at the lowest level since June 2005. <br>
  <br>
  Compassionate Allowances. The compassionate allowances initiative, implemented 
  nationwide in October 2008, seeks to identify cases where the disease or condition 
  is so consistently devastating that SSA can presume the claimant is disabled 
  once a valid diagnosis is confirmed. SSA launched the expedited decision process 
  with 50 conditions&#151;25 rare diseases and 25 cancers. Another 38 conditions 
  were added to this list in February 2010. <br>
  <br>
  At the forefront of congressional and Agency concern is the timeliness of SSA&#146;s 
  disability decisions at the hearings adjudicative level. The average processing 
  time at the hearings level has increased over the years&#151;from 293 days at 
  the end of FY 2001 to 435 days at the end of June 2010. Additionally, the pending 
  hearings workload grew to approximately 694,000 by the end of June 2010&#151;up 
  from about 392,000 cases at the end of FY 2001. <br>
</p>
<p>Improve Hearing Office Procedures. Reducing aged cases is one of the two initiatives 
  SSA has in place to improve hearing office procedures, the second being adjudication 
  of cases by Senior Attorneys. Under the aged claim initiative, SSA focused on 
  eliminating cases 1,000 days or older in FY 2007, cases 900 days or older in 
  FY 2008, cases 850 days or older in FY 2009, and cases 825 days or older in 
  FY 2010. This initiative has refocused the hearings process to ensure the oldest 
  cases are processed first. Under the Senior Attorney program, staff other than 
  ALJs issue fully favorable on-the-record decisions to expedite the decision 
  and conserve ALJ resources for the more complex cases and cases that require 
  a hearing. SSA reported that Senior Attorneys had issued approximately 41,000 
  decisions as of June 2010. <br>
  <br>
  Increase Adjudicatory Capacity. SSA has seven initiatives aimed at increasing 
  adjudicatory capacity. One initiative is hiring new ALJs. In FY 2009, ARRA provided 
  SSA $500 million to assist with increases in retirement and disability workloads, 
  of which $123 million was allocated to the Office of Disability Adjudication 
  and Review (ODAR). Using <br>
  these funds, ODAR hired 30 new ALJs and 535 additional support staff in FY 2009. 
  ODAR also continues to build new hearing offices around the country. In addition, 
  ODAR will be operating five National Hearing Centers by the end of FY 2010. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Increase Efficiency with Automation and Improved Business Process. SSA has more 
  than two dozen initiatives related to automation and business processes. Such 
  initiatives include shared access to electronic files, improved management training, 
  enhanced electronic business processes, and a new quality assurance program. 
  One initiative is expanding the use of video equipment at hearings to increase 
  ALJ productivity and decrease ALJ travel. This video initiative also includes 
  a Representative Video Project that allows claimant representatives to use their 
  equipment to participate in hearings from their own offices. <br>
  <br>
  We will continue to work with SSA as it proceeds with its initiatives. For example, 
  in our June 2010 review of hearing office staffing and performance, we found 
  that ODAR&#146;s staffing ratio was 5.1, exceeding the Agency&#146;s national 
  goal of 4.5 staff per ALJ. We also found most hearing offices exceeded the decision 
  writer per ALJ goal. However, we identified a number of offices that still needed 
  attention to meet the Agency&#146;s goals, and found the staffing ratio methodology 
  needed to be updated. We also found that centralized units were assisting hearing 
  offices with staffing shortages and recommended their expansion. <br>
  <br>
  In a July 2010 review, we reported SSA should be able to achieve its FY 2013 
  pending hearings backlog goal if the Agency has reliably projected the key factors, 
  such as hearing level receipts, ALJ availability levels, ALJ productivity levels, 
  and senior attorney adjudicator decisions through 2013. We also acknowledged 
  that the Agency has varying control over these factors, and a small variance 
  in these projections could cause SSA to exceed the targeted number of cases 
  in its 2013 pending hearings backlog plan. As a result, we noted that continued 
  assessment of the factors, appropriate adjustments, and communication of Agency 
  needs to other parties, including the Congress and the Office of Personnel Management, 
  will be essential to keep this endeavor on track. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2011, we plan to complete 7 reviews and begin 11 reviews in this area. 
  <br>

  <b><br>
  Availability and Use of Vocational Experts for Hearings <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To evaluate the availability and use of vocational experts at hearings offices, 
  including the screening and selection process for such experts. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  The basic function of vocational experts is to provide definitive guidance in 
  the adjudication of cases that require consideration of vocational factors of 
  age, education, training, and work experience.<br>
  <br>
  In recent years, some experts have expressed concerns about how their services 
  are contracted and used. In addition, these experts have questioned the current 
  fees for these services, stating the fees have not been properly adjusted over 
  the years to reflect the true cost of the services performed. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Congressional Response Report: The Office of Disability Adjudication and 
  Review&#146;s Scheduling Procedures for Hearings <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To identify practices at the hearing office, regional, and national levels that 
  may be inconsistent with ODAR&#146;s first-in/first-out scheduling policy. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  On March 31, 2010, we received a request from the Subcommittee on Social Security 
  to review SSA&#146;s first-in/first-out scheduling procedures. We provided the 
  Subcommittee with our first report in April 2010. This second review will expand 
  our assessment to all hearing offices to identify scheduling trends and examine 
  the rationale for those hearings not scheduled according to first-in/first-out. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Office of Disability Adjudication and Review&#146;s Screening Units <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess the role of the screening units in reducing the pending hearings backlog. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  ODAR has implemented several screening units to identify possible on-the-record 
  decisions. For example, ODAR established a Virtual Screening Unit, consisting 
  of 100 senior attorneys in hearing offices nationwide. The Virtual Screening 
  Unit identifies cases with a high probability of a favorable decision. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Role of National Hearing Centers in Reducing the Pending Hearings Backlog 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess the role of the NHCs in addressing the hearings backlog. In particular, 
  we will determine whether the NHCs have contributed to a reduction in case processing 
  time and have best practices that can be shared. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  The NHC is part of SSA&#146;s strategy to address the hearings backlog and reduce 
  case processing time. The NHCs, which conduct all their hearings using video 
  equipment, can target their services to hearing offices and regions with the 
  most significant backlogs. <br>
  <br>
  ODAR has five operating NHCs that are expected to process approximately 21,000 
  cases. NHCs opened/will open in: <br>
  &#149; Falls Church, Virginia in FY 2008; </p>
<p>&#149; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Chicago, Illinois; and Baltimore, Maryland 
  in FY 2009. </p>
<p>&#149; St. Louis, Missouri in FY 2010. </p>
<p><b>Senior Attorney Adjudicator Initiative<br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess the role of the Senior Attorney Adjudicator program in reducing the 
  pending claims backlog. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  The Senior Attorney Adjudicator program&#146;s goals are to expedite decisions 
  and conserve ALJ resources for the more complex claims that require a hearing. 
  <br>
  Under the program, hearing office senior attorney advisors, hearing office directors, 
  group supervisors, and attorneys in the regional offices at the GS-13 level 
  and above issue fully-favorable decisions. Pending claims are assigned to each 
  senior attorney adjudicator by the local hearing office management, who also 
  decide the amount of time a senior attorney adjudicator devotes to this duty. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Training of Hearing Office Employees <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess SSA&#146;s efforts to train employees at ODAR&#146;s hearing offices 
  to ensure they have the requisite skills to successfully perform their duties. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA&#146;s strategic goal to eliminate the hearings backlog and prevent its 
  recurrence has two objectives, (1) increase capacity to hear and decide cases, 
  and (2) improve workload management practices throughout the hearings process. 
  In FYs 2009 and 2010, ARRA funds, as well as increased appropriations, have 
  significantly increased the number of ALJs and support staff to process the 
  hearings workload. This review will assess the training programs in place to 
  ensure both new and existing ODAR employees have the requisite skills to effectively 
  perform their duties.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Use of Video Hearings to Reduce the Hearing Case Backlog <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess the ongoing implementation and use of video hearing technology in 
  ODAR. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Increased video hearings are part of the Agency&#146;s efforts to reduce the 
  size of the backlog and improve hearing timeliness by enhancing organizational 
  flexibility to assist backlogged offices, improving ALJ productivity since less 
  time is spent traveling to remote sites, and shortening the time claimants wait 
  for hearings to be scheduled. The video hearing process also allows expert witnesses 
  to participate remotely, potentially reducing scheduling delays and hearing-related 
  travel costs. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Strengthen the Integrity and Protection of the Social Security Number <br>
  </b><br>
  The SSN is heavily relied on in U.S. society as an identifier and valuable as 
  an illegal commodity. Accuracy in recording workers&#146; earnings is critical 
  because SSA calculates future benefit payments based on the earnings an individual 
  has accumulated over his or her lifetime. As such, properly assigning SSNs only 
  to those individuals authorized to obtain them, protecting SSN information once 
  the numbers are assigned, and accurately posting the earnings reported under 
  SSNs are critical SSA missions. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Efforts to Protect the Social Security Number <br>
  </b><br>
  To its credit, SSA has implemented numerous improvements in its SSN assignment, 
  or enumeration process. With these new procedures/requirements, the enumeration 
  workload has increased in complexity for SSA personnel. Despite these challenges, 
  we believe SSA&#146;s improved procedures have reduced its risk of improperly 
  assigning these important numbers. Some of SSA&#146;s more notable enumeration 
  improvements include the following. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2009, SSA processed approximately 6 million original and 12 million replacement 
  SSN cards and received approximately $671 billion in employment taxes related 
  to earnings under assigned SSNs. Protecting the SSN and properly posting the 
  wages reported under SSNs are critical to ensuring SSN integrity and that eligible 
  individuals receive the full benefits due them. </p>
<p>&#149; Establishing Enumeration Centers in many States that focus exclusively 
  on assigning SSNs and issuing SSN cards. </p>
<p>&#149; Requiring that field office personnel who process SSN applications use 
  a Web-based, intranet application known as SSNAP. This process combines the 
  functionality of the two prior systems, the SS-5 Assistant and the Modernized 
  Enumeration System, into a single system. Because of numerous policies and procedures 
  involved with processing SSNs, including third party verification of applicant 
  documents, SSA developed SSNAP to help reinforce those policies by collecting 
  data in standardized fields and facilitating interfaces with other agency systems 
  in which verification of applicant information is required. </p>
<p>&#149; Strengthening the standards and requirements for identity documents 
  presented with SSN applications to ensure the correct individual obtains the 
  correct SSN. <br>
  <br>
  We applaud the Agency for these efforts. Nevertheless, we continue to have concerns 
  regarding SSN assignment and protection. For example, the Agency cannot prohibit 
  the collection and use of SSNs. Our audit and investigative work have taught 
  us that the more SSNs are unnecessarily used, the higher the probability that 
  these numbers could be used to commit crimes throughout society. We are also 
  concerned about the practice of assigning SSNs to certain categories of noncitizens 
  who will only be in the United States temporarily but are allowed to obtain 
  SSNs that are valid for life. Further, we believe controls over the issuance 
  of SSN Verification Printouts are insufficient to prevent improper attainment 
  of these sensitive documents and disclosure of PII. <br>
  <br>
  Finally, SSA is devoting resources to develop an on-line system for issuing 
  replacement Social Security cards. While we support the Agency&#146;s decision 
  to offer more services on-line to enhance customer service, we are concerned 
  about the potential for unscrupulous individuals to manipulate such a system. 
  As such, we encourage the Agency to proceed carefully with this initiative, 
  ensuring proper authentication controls are in place before full implementation. 
  <br>
  <br>
  To further enhance SSN integrity, we believe SSA should <br>
  <br>
  &#149; support legislation to limit public and private entities&#146; collection 
  and use of SSNs and improve the protection of this information when obtained, 
</p>
<p>&#149; continue its efforts to safeguard and protect PII, and </p>
<p>&#149; develop stringent authentication measures to ensure the highest level 
  of security and identity assurance before moving forward in offering on-line 
  replacement SSN cards. <br>
  <br>
  <b>The Social Security Number and Reported Earnings <br>
  </b><br>
  Properly posting earnings ensures eligible individuals receive the full retirement, 
  survivors, and/or disability benefits due them. If earnings information is reported 
  incorrectly or not reported at all, SSA cannot ensure all individuals entitled 
  to benefits are receiving the correct payment amounts. In addition, SSA&#146;s 
  programs depend on earnings information to determine whether an individual is 
  eligible for benefits and to calculate the amount of benefit payments. <br>
  <br>
  SSA spends scarce resources correcting earnings data when incorrect information 
  is reported. The Earnings Suspense File (ESF) is the Agency&#146;s record of 
  annual wage reports for which wage earners&#146; names and SSNs fail to match 
  SSA&#146;s records. As of October 2009, the ESF had accumulated about $836 billion 
  in wages and 296 million wage items for TYs 1937 through 2007. In TY 2007 alone, 
  the ESF grew by $90 billion in wages and 10.7 million wage items. <br>
  <br>
  SSA has taken steps to reduce the size and growth of the ESF. The Agency offers 
  employers the ability to verify names and SSNs of their employees using the 
  Agency&#146;s Social Security Number Verification Service, which is an on-line 
  verification program, before reporting wages to SSA. In FY 2009, employers submitted 
  over 99 million verifications. <br>
  SSA also supports the Department of Homeland Security in administering the E-Verify 
  program, which assists employers in verifying the employment eligibility of 
  newly hired employees. As of September 4, 2010, about 222,000 employers, representing 
  about 794,000 locations, were enrolled to use E-Verify. As of that date, these 
  employers had submitted approximately 15 million queries in 2010. <br>
  <br>
  While SSA cannot control all the factors associated with erroneous wage reports, 
  it can improve wage reporting by informing employers about potential SSN misuse 
  cases, identifying and resolving employer reporting problems, encouraging greater 
  use of the Agency&#146;s employee verification programs, and enhancing the employee 
  verification feedback to provide employers with sufficient information on potential 
  employee issues. SSA can also improve coordination with other Federal agencies 
  with separate, yet related, mandates. For example, the Agency needs to work 
  with the IRS to achieve more accurate wage reporting. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2011, we plan to complete eight reviews and begin eight reviews in this 
  area.<br>

  <b>Controls for Issuing Social Security Number Verification Printouts <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether (1) SSA implemented the recommendations in our December 
  2008 report, and (2) field offices on the border of United States and Mexico 
  issued a significantly higher number of SSN Verification Printouts. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  SSA issues the SSN Verification Printout to all numberholders who request them. 
  However, SSA&#146;s proof of identity standard for the Printout is lower than 
  that of a replacement SSN card. There is no limit on the number of Printouts 
  a numberholder may request in a day or year. The Printout is free and provided 
  to the requestor instantly at an SSA field office. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Disability Beneficiaries with Wages Reported to the Earnings Suspense File 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To identify disabled beneficiaries potentially working under another person&#146;s 
  SSN. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Employers report their employees&#146; wages to SSA at the end of each Tax Year 
  (TY). Wages on those reports containing invalid names and/or SSNs cannot be 
  posted to an individual&#146;s earnings record by SSA. Instead, such wages are 
  placed in the ESF&#151;a repository for unmatched wages. <br>
  SSA sends correspondence to employees to resolve SSN and/or name discrepancies 
  on reported earnings. The correspondence provides the wage earner with information 
  about the reported name/SSN and wage amount and requests that the reported information 
  be reviewed, verified or corrected where possible. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Follow-up: Social Security Number Cards Issued After Death <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA complied with its policy concerning the issuance of 
  original and replacement SSN cards for individuals who were deceased. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Effective November 2002, SSA amended its policy and eliminated the provision 
  that allowed the issuance of replacement cards on behalf of deceased individuals. 
  The amended policy states that SSA can offer to provide verification, such as 
  third-party verification, an SSN Verification Printout, or instructions on how 
  to obtain a numerical identification record; however, a replacement card will 
  not be issued. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Questionable, Overstated, and/or Missing Wages in the Master Earnings File 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To (1) evaluate SSA&#146;s controls for manually posting wages to the MEF and 
  (2) determine whether these postings could relate to fraud, overstated wages, 
  and/or missing wages in the MEF. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Individuals occasionally inform SSA about wages that are missing from their 
  earnings history. SSA personnel follow explicit instructions in resolving earnings 
  discrepancies and answering earnings inquiries. If they are unable to resolve 
  the earnings problem, they establish the case in the Item Correction system. 
  If the missing earnings are not located in the ESF, the field office uses routine 
  procedures for adding the missing earnings to the wage earner&#146;s record. 
  Missing earnings in wage reports may result from <br>
  <br>
  &#149; possible fraud by the individual to increase earnings, add quarters of 
  coverage, and improperly obtain SSA benefits; </p>
<p>&#149; errors in reports filed by employers and/or self-employed individuals; 
</p>
<p>&#149; errors in transcribing reports from employers and self-employed individuals; 
  and/or </p>
<p>&#149; failure of employers or self-employed individuals to file the required 
  reports with SSA and/or the IRS. </p>
<p><b>Quick Response Evaluation: Social Security Number Replacement Card Non-Receipts 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To determine the effectiveness of SSA&#146;s controls over SSN replacement cards 
  released because of a non-receipt report. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  OIG has received reports from local field office staff that non-receipt reports 
  were being used to get around SSN card limits. Claiming non-receipt of an SSN 
  card may not count toward the limits on the number of SSN cards a numberholder 
  can receive in a single year or over his or her lifetime. <br>
  <br>
  Per SSA policy, the non-receipt of an SSN card is defined as &quot;. . . when 
  an applicant alleges they have not received their SSN card and at least one 
  (1) week has elapsed from the date the [application] was processed, as determined 
  by the cycle date on the corresponding Numident.&quot; The request must be made 
  within 45 days of the cycle date and the applicant&#146;s name and address must 
  match the original request. If the applicant believes there is a potential problem 
  with delivering the card to his or her address, a replacement card can be delivered 
  to the SSA field office. The applicant could then receive the replacement card 
  at the field office. Field office staff is responsible for ensuring the person 
  alleging non-receipt is the numberholder. <br>

  <b>Social Security Number Card Processing at the Second Support Center <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To assess the internal controls over the processing of SSN cards at the SSC. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Although the SSN card has a number of security features built into the printing 
  process to prevent the card from being fraudulently duplicated, strict procedures 
  are required to control the processing and destruction of SSN cards. <br>
  <br>
  SSN cards are printed at SSA Headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland. Beginning 
  in June 2010, SSA will also print SSN cards at the SSC. To properly safeguard 
  SSN cards throughout the printing process, SSA needs to establish strict handling 
  procedures. Since the SSN card process will be a new function at the SSC, SSA 
  needs to appropriately prepare this site for printing SSN cards. This would 
  include having fully operational equipment; a trained, qualified staff; sufficient 
  quantities of SSN card stock; and security measures. <br>

  <b>Social Security Numbers Assigned to H-1B Visa Holders <br>
  <br>
  Objective </b><br>
  To (1) assess SSN use by noncitizens with an H-1B work visa and (2) evaluate 
  SSA&#146;s compliance with policies and procedures when processing H-1B SSN 
  applications. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Employers use the H-1B visa program to employ foreign workers in &#147;specialty&#148; 
  occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in a specialized 
  field and a bachelor&#146;s degree or its equivalent. Typical H-1B occupations 
  include architects, engineers, computer programmers, accountants, doctors, and 
  college professors. <br>
  <br>
  According to a 2008 report issued by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 
  13.4 percent of petitions filed for H-1B visas on behalf of employers were fraudulent 
  and another 7.3 percent contained technical violations. The types of misrepresentation 
  included fraudulent educational degrees or experience letters, forged signatures 
  on supporting documentation, visa holders who never worked at the location on 
  the application, and workers paid below the prevailing wage. <br>

  <b>Use of Employment Verification by the Social Security Administration&#146;s 
  Contractors and Subcontractors </b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Objective </b><br>
  To determine whether SSA contractors and subcontractors are complying with the 
  requirement to verify employment eligibility of their employees through the 
  E-Verify system. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Background </b><br>
  Effective September 8, 2009, Executive Order 12989 directed all executive departments 
  and agencies to require that contractors electronically verify employment authorization 
  of their employees performing work under qualifying Federal contracts. <br>
  <br>
  A contract is considered exempt if one or more of the following apply. <br>
  &#149; It is for fewer than 120 days. </p>
<p>&#149; It is valued at less than $100,000. </p>
<p>&#149; All work is performed outside the United States. </p>
<p>&#149; It includes only commercially available off-the-shelf items and related 
  services. </p>
<p>The E-Verify Federal contractor rule also requires that certain prime contractors 
  require their subcontractors to use E-Verify when <br>
  1. the prime contract includes the E-Verify clause, </p>
<p>2. the subcontractor is for commercial or noncommercial services or construction, 
</p>
<p>3. the subcontract has a value of more than $3,000, and/or </p>
<p>4. the subcontractor includes work performed in the United States. </p>
<p>Prime contractors should provide general oversight to their subcontractors 
  to ensure they meet their contractual requirements. The prime contractor may 
  be subject to fines and penalties if it knowingly continues to work with a subcontractor 
  who is in violation of the E-Verify requirement. </p>
