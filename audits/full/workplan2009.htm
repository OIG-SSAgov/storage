I am pleased to present the Office of Audit's Fiscal Year 2009 Annual Work Plan. 
The reviews described in the Plan are designed to address those areas that are 
most vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse. Since 1997, we have provided our perspective 
on the top challenges facing Social Security Administration (SSA) management to 
the Congress, SSA and other key decisionmakers. For Fiscal Year 2009, the Office 
of the Inspector General has identified the following management challenges: Social 
Security Number Protection, Management of the Disability Process, Improper Payments 
and Recovery of Overpayments, Internal Control Environment, Systems Security and 
Critical Infrastructure Protection, and Service Delivery and Electronic Government. 
<br>
<br>
The Plan describes 105 reviews we plan to complete in Fiscal Year 2009 and 106 
reviews we plan to begin in Fiscal Year 2009. In developing these reviews, we 
worked with Agency management to ensure we provide a coordinated effort. <br>
<br>
Our Plan is dynamic, so we encourage continuous feedback and additional study 
suggestions. This flexibility enables us to meet emerging and critical issues 
evolving in the upcoming year. <br>
<br>
Steven L. Schaeffer <br>
Assistant Inspector General for Audit <br>
<br>
Executive Overview <br>
The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) improves the Social Security Administration's 
(SSA) programs and operations and protects them against fraud, waste, and abuse 
by conducting independent and objective audits, evaluations, and investigations. 
We provide timely, useful, and reliable information and advice to Administration 
officials, the Congress, and the public. The Office of Audit conducts financial 
and performance audits of SSA's programs and operations and makes recommendations 
to ensure program objectives are achieved effectively and efficiently. Financial 
audits assess the reliability of financial data reported by SSA in its annual 
financial statements and any number of managerial informative reports. Performance 
audits review the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of SSA's programs and 
operations. The Office of Audit also conducts short-term management and program 
evaluations and projects on issues of concern to SSA, the Congress, and the general 
public. In Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, we issued 108 reports with over $3.5 billion 
in monetary findings. 
<p>Annual Work Plan <br>
  Our Annual Work Plan (Plan) outlines our perspective of the major management 
  and performance challenges facing SSA and serves as a tool for communicating 
  our priorities to SSA, the Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), 
  and other interested parties. The activities described address the fundamental 
  goals related to SSA's mission to deliver Social Security services that meet 
  the changing needs of the public. Our work is prioritized to focus our resources 
  on those areas that are most vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse. To ensure 
  we provide a coordinated effort, we work closely with the Offices of Investigations, 
  Counsel to the Inspector General, External Relations, and Technology and Resource 
  Management. <br>
  <br>
  Our Plan is categorized to mirror the top management challenges that cut across 
  the Government, as well as those identified by the Agency and the Social Security 
  Advisory Board. <br>
  <br>
  This Plan describes 105 reviews we intend to complete and 106 reviews we intend 
  to begin in FY 2009 in the following issue areas. <br>
  Social Security Number Protection <br>
  Management of the Disability Process <br>
  Improper Payments and Recovery of Overpayments <br>
  Internal Control Environment <br>
  Systems Security and Critical Infrastructure Protection <br>
  Service Delivery and Electronic Government<br>
  <br>
  To assist us in this analysis, we crosswalked the Commissioner and the Social 
  Security Advisory Board priorities to those identified by our prior and ongoing 
  work. The following table demonstrates that our perspective is congruent with 
  other key decisionmakers. <br>
  <br>
  In preparing this Plan, we solicited suggestions from the Agency. We received 
  a number of suggestions for inclusion in our Plan, and we have incorporated 
  as many of them as possible. <br>
  <br>
  We recognize this Plan is dynamic, so we encourage continuous feedback and additional 
  suggestions. This flexibility enables us to meet emerging and critical issues 
  evolving throughout the upcoming year. <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER PROTECTION <br>
  In Fiscal Year (FY) 2007, the Social Security Administration (SSA) processed 
  approximately 17.6 million original and replacement Social Security number (SSN) 
  cards and received approximately $647 billion in employment taxes related to 
  earnings under assigned SSNs. Because the SSN is so heavily relied on in U.S. 
  society as an identifier, it is also valuable as an illegal commodity. Yet, 
  because SSA calculates future benefit payments based on the earnings an individual 
  has accumulated over his or her lifetime, accuracy in recording those earnings 
  is critical. As such, properly assigning SSNs only to those individuals authorized 
  to obtain them, protecting SSN information once the numbers are assigned, and 
  accurately posting the earnings reported under SSNs are critical components 
  of SSA's mission. <br>
  <br>
  Efforts to Protect the Social Security Number <br>
  To its credit, over the last decade, SSA has implemented numerous improvements 
  in its SSN assignment, or enumeration process. We acknowledge that with these 
  new procedures/ requirements, the enumeration workload has increased in complexity 
  for SSA personnel and resulted in some difficulties or delays for SSN applicants. 
  Despite these challenges, we believe SSA's improved procedures help ensure the 
  Agency is properly assigning these important numbers. Some of SSA's more notable 
  enumeration improvements include the following. <br>
  <br>
  Verifying the authenticity of all documents evidencing citizenship or lawful 
  alien status before assigning an original SSN. <br>
  Establishing six Enumeration Centers in Brooklyn and Queens, New York; Las Vegas, 
  Nevada; Phoenix, Arizona (Downtown and North); and Orlando, Florida, that focus 
  exclusively on assigning SSNs and issuing SSN cards. <br>
  <br>
  Requiring that field office (FO) personnel processing SSN applications use the 
  Agency's SS-5 Assistant, a Microsoft Access-based application intended to increase 
  control over the SSN application process. This program provides FO personnel 
  processing SSN applications structured interview questions and requires certain 
  data to complete the application process. Additionally, SSA plans to implement 
  a web-based enumeration system known as the SSN Application Process in the next 
  few years. <br>
  <br>
  Strengthening the standards and requirements for identity documents presented 
  with SSN applications to ensure the correct individual obtains the correct SSN. 
  <br>
  We applaud the Agency for these efforts. Nevertheless, based on our recent audit 
  work, we continue to have concerns regarding SSN assignment and protection. 
  For example, the Agency has few mechanisms to curb the unnecessary collection 
  and use of SSNs. In September 2007, we reported on the collection and use of 
  SSNs by State and local governments for such programs as identifying and tracking 
  K-12 students, posting certain records on the Internet and prescription drug 
  monitoring. Additionally, in FY 2008, we issued a report discussing the vulnerabilities 
  caused by using and displaying SSNs on Medicare cards. In these instances, we 
  believe an alternate identifier would suffice and provide better protection 
  against identity theft. Our audit and investigative work have taught us that 
  the more SSNs are unnecessarily used, the higher the probability these numbers 
  could be used to commit crimes throughout society. <br>
  <br>
  In addition, we issued two audit reports in which we discussed our concern with 
  the practice of assigning SSNs to noncitizens who will only be in the United 
  States for a few months-but are allowed to obtain SSNs that are valid for life. 
  Specifically, these reports addressed SSNs issued to certain exchange visitors 
  and those who enter the United States with a 3-month fianc&eacute; visa. Further, 
  in FY 2008, we issued an audit report in which we concluded that SSA's controls 
  over the issuance of SSN Verification Printouts were not sufficient to preclude 
  individuals other than the numberholder from improperly obtaining these sensitive 
  documents that contain personally identifiable information (PII). Additionally, 
  we remain concerned with SSA's plans to expand the Enumeration at Entry process 
  to other classes of noncitizens until it implements significant improvements, 
  which we recommended in two audit reports in 2005 and 2008, respectively. <br>
  <br>
  The Agency continues to modify the information it shares with employers. Under 
  the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) (Pub. L. 
  No. 108-458), SSA is required to add both death and fraud indicators to the 
  SSN verification systems for employers, State agencies issuing drivers' licenses 
  and identity cards, and other verification routines, as determined appropriate 
  by the Commissioner of Social Security. SSA added death indicators to those 
  verification routines used by employers and State agencies in March 2006 and 
  added fraud indicators in August 2007. <br>
  <br>
  Finally, SSA is devoting resources to developing an on-line system for issuing 
  replacement SSN cards. While we support the Agency's decision to offer more 
  services on-line to enhance customer service, we are concerned about the potential 
  for unscrupulous individuals to manipulate such a system. We are particularly 
  concerned about the Agency's plans for issuing replacement SSN cards on-line 
  given the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) experience with fraud and abuse in 
  its e-file program. <br>
  <br>
  To further enhance SSN integrity, we believe SSA should <br>
  support legislation to limit public and private entities' collection and use 
  of SSNs and improve the protection of this information when obtained, <br>
  work with the IRS to develop alternatives to assigning SSNs to noncitizens who 
  may only be in the country for a few months, <br>
  continue its efforts to safeguard and protect PII, <br>
  improve the Enumeration at Entry process before expansion, and <br>
  develop stringent authentication measures to ensure the highest level of security 
  and identity assurance before moving forward in offering on-line replacement 
  SSN cards.<br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Number and Reported Earnings <br>
  Properly posting earnings is essential in determining whether individuals are 
  eligible to receive retirement, survivor, and/or disability benefits as well 
  as to calculate the benefit amounts. If earnings information is reported incorrectly 
  or not reported at all, SSA cannot ensure all individuals eligible for benefits 
  are receiving the correct payment amounts. <br>
  <br>
  SSA spends scarce resources correcting earnings data when incorrect information 
  is reported. The Earnings Suspense File (ESF) is the Agency's record of annual 
  wage reports for which wage earners' names and/or SSNs fail to match SSA's records. 
  As of October 2007, the ESF had accumulated about $661 billion in wages and 
  275 million wage items for Tax Years (TY) 1937 through 2005. In TY 2005 alone, 
  the ESF grew by $75 billion in wages and 10.3 million wage items. <br>
  <br>
  While SSA has limited control over the factors that cause erroneous wage reports 
  submitted each year, there are areas where the Agency can improve its processes. 
  SSA can improve wage reporting by informing employers about potential SSN misuse 
  cases, identifying and resolving employer reporting problems, encouraging greater 
  use of the Agency's employee verification programs, and enhancing the employee 
  verification feedback to provide employers with sufficient information on potential 
  employee issues. SSA also needs to coordinate with other Federal agencies with 
  separate, yet related, mandates, such as the IRS and Department of Homeland 
  Security (DHS). <br>
  <br>
  In our audits, we have encouraged SSA to increase collaboration with the IRS 
  to achieve more accurate wage reporting, including cases where earnings are 
  disclaimed by individuals and need to be removed from SSA and IRS records. Both 
  the IRS and SSA have encountered cases where the name and SSN combination is 
  correct and the wages are posted to an earner's record only to learn that the 
  SSN owner did not work for the employer and is the victim of SSN misuse. For 
  example, in June 2008, we reported that SSA had received wage referrals from 
  the IRS for approximately 28,000 SSN owners who had disputed reported wages 
  with the IRS for prior TYs. In other cases, the earners reported fraudulent 
  income in an attempt to gain SSA and/or IRS benefits. In an August 2007 report, 
  we noted that about 12 percent of individuals who disclaimed self-employment 
  income for TYs 2003 through 2005 had initially reported the self-employment 
  income to qualify for Social Security benefits and the IRS' Earned Income Tax 
  Credit. SSA needs to ensure it works closely with the IRS to remove such wages 
  to (1) assist the numberholders with earnings discrepancies, (2) minimize improper 
  IRS tax assessments, and (3) reduce the chance of improper SSA and IRS payments 
  based on incorrect information. <br>
  <br>
  In our reports, we have also encouraged greater collaboration with DHS on some 
  employment eligibility verification issues. For example, in a September 2007 
  audit, we identified vulnerabilities with the E-Verify system (formerly the 
  Basic Pilot), which is a joint initiative between SSA and DHS that assists employers 
  in verifying the employment eligibility of newly hired employees. In our report, 
  we encouraged SSA and DHS to work together to help resolve the vulnerabilities. 
  As of June 2008, the Commissioner of Social Security had expressed his desire 
  to work with DHS to help resolve some of the weaknesses we identified. Specifically, 
  he expressed the need for SSA and DHS to develop a more stringent registration 
  process for E-Verify to reasonably guard against improper users registering 
  and using the E-Verify system. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2009, we plan to complete 12 reviews and begin 9 reviews in the Social 
  Security Number Protection challenge. <br>
  <br>
  WE PLAN TO COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING REVIEWS IN FY 2009 <br>
  Appropriate Use of Social Security Administration Data by Third Parties <br>
  Assignment of Social Security Numbers to Individuals in the Commonwealth of 
  the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa <br>
  Completeness of Death Information in the Social Security Administration's Systems 
  <br>
  Consent-based Social Security Number Verification Program Earnings Records with 
  Multiple Employers <br>
  Field Office Workload Related to Tentative Nonconfirmation Responses to E-Verify 
  <br>
  Fraudulent, Overstated, and/or Missing Wages in the Master Earnings File Potential 
  Overpayments Due to Incomplete Quarterly Wage Data from the Office of Child 
  Support Enforcement <br>
  Proper Allocation of Back Pay <br>
  R-1 Religious Workers' Use of Social Security Numbers <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Compliance with Social Security Number 
  Replacement Card Issuance Provisions of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism 
  Prevention Act of 2004 '<br>

  Revenue Service <br>
  <br>
  WE PLAN TO BEGIN THE FOLLOWING REVIEWS IN FY 2009 <br>
  Contractor Protection of Personally Identifiable Information and Incident Reporting 
  <br>
  Correspondence Containing Personally Identifiable Information Mailed to Claimants 
  <br>
  Disabled Beneficiaries Working Under Another Person's Social Security Number 
  <br>
  Follow-up: The Social Security Administration's Program for Issuing Replacement 
  Social <br>
  Security Cards to Prisoners <br>
  Individuals Receiving Social Security Cards After Benefits Have Been Suspended 
  <br>
  Orlando Social Security Card Center <br>
  The Disability Determination Services' Custodial Services <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Compliance with the Ensign Amendment <br>
  The Social Security Administration's Special Indicator Codes <br>
  <br>
  APPROPRIATE USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION DATA BY THIRD PARTIES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the extent of SSA's data sharing with third parties and assess 
  the Agency's controls to ensure third parties are appropriately accessing SSA's 
  systems. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The Privacy Act, other Federal laws, and SSA's disclosure policies allow the 
  Agency to share data with third parties. Under these rules, SSA provides access 
  to Federal, State, International, and private organizations. The data exchange 
  may be either program or non-program related and is established under a variety 
  of agreements. SSA has about 824 data exchanges with about 86 different users. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Of the 824 data exchanges, 83 are with Federal agencies, 731 are with State 
  agencies, and 10 are with private organizations. The 83 Federal agencies include 
  the Department of Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Centers for 
  Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Bureau of Census, and Department of Labor. 
  Examples of the type of data shared with these organizations include <br>
  (1) the Death Master File (DMF), (2) verification of SSNs, (3) earnings data, 
  and (4) beneficiary information. The frequency SSA shares its data with these 
  organizations varies, including annually, biannually, quarterly, monthly, and 
  weekly. However, most of the exchanges appear to be daily. <br>
  <br>
  ASSIGNMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF 
  THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS AND AMERICAN SAMOA <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess SSA's process for assigning SSNs to individuals in the Commonwealth 
  of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) and American Samoa. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Individuals born in the CNMI are U.S. citizens, while those born in American 
  Samoa are considered U.S. nationals (for SSA purposes, these classifications 
  carry the same benefits). However, thousands of noncitizens travel to these 
  U.S. territories each year to work. In 2007, SSA FOs in Saipan, CNMI, and Pago 
  Pago, American Samoa, issued over 5,000 original SSNs to U.S. citizens and noncitizens. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The Department of the Interior and Government Accountability Office (GAO) have 
  expressed concerns about the pre-screening process for noncitizens who wish 
  to enter the CNMI to work. For example, the CNMI does not issue visas, conduct 
  interviews or check fingerprints for noncitizens who wish to travel to the CNMI. 
  Additionally, the CNMI does not have positions equivalent to Federal immigration 
  officers, who are responsible for determining whether each noncitizen is admissible. 
</p>
<p>We are concerned that lack of U.S. jurisdiction over immigration in American 
  Samoa could create the potential for similar security weaknesses. The Attorney 
  General's Office in American Samoa is investigating the Government's Immigration 
  Office for allegedly accepting money to provide immigration documents to nonresidents. 
  Additionally, incidents of fraudulent birth certificates have occurred in American 
  Samoa. Fraudulent immigration and birth documents could affect the issuance 
  of SSNs by SSA's FOs. <br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, our preliminary work raises concerns as to whether a provision 
  exists for SSA to recognize a work permit issued by these territories to noncitizen 
  workers. We are unsure whether recognition of such work permits satisfies SSA's 
  requirements for assigning SSNs. Because SSA must rely on the CNMI and American 
  Samoa immigration systems (not DHS immigration verification and screening), 
  we are concerned about the potential for SSA to assign SSNs to individuals who 
  may not be who they purport to be. <br>
  <br>
  COMPLETENESS OF DEATH INFORMATION IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S SYSTEMS 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the extent to which deceased individuals were not properly recorded 
  in SSA's systems and whether earnings were improperly posted after death. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA's DMF is a publicly available database containing over 82 million death 
  records. The DMF is extracted from the Numident and updated based on verified 
  and unverified reports of deaths to SSA. Relatives of deceased individuals and 
  funeral directors are the primary sources of death information recorded in the 
  DMF. In addition, State and Federal agencies, financial institutions, and postal 
  authorities provide death information to SSA. The DMF is provided monthly to 
  the Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service, which in 
  turn makes it available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. 
  The 2002 SSA Bulletin, The Social Security Administration's Death Master File: 
  The Completeness of Death Reporting at Older Ages, stated that for most years 
  since 1973, results suggest the DMF includes 93 to 96 percent of deaths of individuals 
  aged 65 or older. Because at least 4 percent of deaths are missing on the DMF, 
  we are concerned individuals could use SSNs of deceased individuals to work 
  illegally. <br>
  <br>
  FIELD OFFICE WORKLOAD RELATED TO TENTATIVE NONCONFIRMATION RESPONSES TO E-VERIFY 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To evaluate SSA's FO workload associated with Tentative Nonconfirmation (TNC) 
  responses generated from the E-Verify program. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA participates in a joint initiative with DHS, the E-Verify system, formerly 
  known as the Basic Pilot. E-Verify assists employers in verifying the employment 
  eligibility of newly hired employees. Under E-Verify, employers will receive 
  notification of SSA's TNC of employment eligibility when the SSN, name, or date 
  of birth does not match the information in SSA's database or if a death indicator 
  is present. In addition, employers will receive an SSA TNC if the new hire indicated 
  he or she was a U.S. citizen and SSA's records did not show the person was a 
  U.S. citizen. <br>
  <br>
  As of FY 2007, E-Verify had processed about 3.3 million verification requests, 
  of which 261,000 cases involved TNC responses due to invalid SSNs, no matches 
  on dates of birth and/or names, and death indicator. SSA recently implemented 
  a new program called EV-STAR to resolve such responses generated from E-Verify. 
  The system allows FO personnel to transmit case dispositions to the employer 
  through E-Verify. <br>
  <br>
  From FYs 1997 to 2007, SSA received about $8.6 million in reimbursement from 
  DHS for FO workload attributed to E-Verify. SSA did not receive any reimbursement 
  in FY 2006 because DHS notified SSA that it did not receive an annual appropriation 
  to fund the E-Verify work performed by SSA for DHS. <br>
  <br>
  FRAUDULENT, OVERSTATED, AND/OR MISSINGWAGES IN THE MASTER EARNINGS FILE <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To (1) evaluate SSA's controls for manually posting wages to the MEF and (2) 
  determine whether these new postings could relate to fraud, overstated wages, 
  and/or missing wages in the MEF. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Individuals occasionally inform SSA about wages that are missing from their 
  earnings records. SSA personnel follow explicit instructions in resolving earnings 
  discrepancies and answering earnings inquiries. They perform limited ESF searches 
  during their contacts with wage earners. If staff in SSA's teleservice centers 
  cannot resolve the earnings problem, they establish the case in the Item Correction 
  2.8 system for referral to the servicing FO. When the FO staff receives the 
  case, it uses Item Correction to conduct a thorough search of the ESF. If the 
  missing earnings are not in the ESF, the FO follows routine procedures for developing 
  the missing earnings. Missing earnings in wage reports may result from possible 
  fraud by the individual to increase earnings/add quarters of credit and improperly 
  obtain SSA benefits; errors in reports filed by employers and/or self-employed 
  individuals; errors in transcribing reports from employers and self-employed 
  individuals; and/or failure of employers or self-employed individuals to file 
  the required reports with SSA and/or the IRS. <br>
  <br>
  POTENTIAL OVERPAYMENTS DUE TO INCOMPLETE QUARTERLY WAGE DATA FROM THE OFFICE 
  OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether more accurate quarterly wage data from the Office of Child 
  Support Enforcement (OCSE) could identify unreported work activity, reduce overpayments, 
  and lead to program savings. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Starting in 1999, SSA matched the Social Security Income Records to the OCSE 
  National Directory of New Hires, which includes quarterly information from all 
  States. This quarterly match gathers data from all 50 States and the District 
  of Columbia. The match generates electronic alerts to the FOs. Because wages 
  and unemployment compensation are significant sources of potential overpayments 
  of agency benefits (for example, Supplemental Security Income [SSI] payments 
  and Retirement, Survivors and Disability benefits), these computer matches enhance 
  detection of payment inaccuracies and potential fraud and abuse situations. 
  <br>
  <br>
  PROPER ALLOCATION OF BACK PAY <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA is properly recording back pay under statute on a numberholder's 
  earnings record. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  In 1966, the Back Pay Act was created to grant a cause of action to an employee 
  who has lost pay as a result of a wrongful personnel action. Its purpose is 
  to permit such an employee to recover money damages sufficient to make him or 
  her whole. The Act was amended in 1978 to adopt not only the case law that had 
  evolved since its inception but to conform to the provisions of the Civil Service 
  Reform Act. Specifically, the amended Act provides that an &quot;administrative 
  determination&quot; supporting a monetary award may include &quot;decisions 
  relating to an unfair labor practice or grievance.&quot; In addition, the amended 
  Act provides for the payment of interest on awards of back pay and attorney 
  fees. The intent of the Act is to make the grievant whole - nothing less but 
  also nothing more. <br>
  Once back pay is awarded, SSA must record these wages on the individual's earnings 
  record to ensure proper crediting for future Social Security benefits. Whether 
  SSA records the back pay information accurately can impact the amount and/or 
  timing of those future benefits. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>R-1 RELIGIOUS WORKERS' USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess R-1 religious workers' use of SSNs. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The Department of State issues R-1 visas to members of religious organizations 
  to live and work in the United States for a specific period of time. The program 
  permits foreign nationals with religious training to obtain a work visa if a 
  U.S.-based religious institution sponsors them for employment. However, religious 
  workers are not permitted to obtain a secular job. From April 2005 through March 
  2006, SSA assigned over 5,000 original SSNs to R-1 religious workers. DHS and 
  GAO have identified incidents of fraud in the religious worker program. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S COMPLIANCE WITH SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER 
  REPLACEMENT CARD ISSUANCE PROVISIONS OF THE INTELLIGENCE REFORM AND TERRORISM 
  PROTECTION ACT OF 2004 <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA is complying with IRTPA. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  IRTPA limits the number of replacement SSN cards an individual may receive to 
  3 per year and 10 in a lifetime beginning with cards issued on or after December 
  17, 2005, with certain exceptions. SSA has the authority to allow for exceptions 
  and issue a replacement SSN card beyond the limits. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S WAGE RECONCILIATION PROCESS WITH THE INTERNAL 
  REVENUE SERVICE <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess the effectiveness of SSA and the IRS' reconciliation process in correcting 
  SSA's earnings records. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA seeks to ensure that Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) reports 
  of Social Security and Medicare wages are received timely and are accurately 
  recorded in the MEF. To accomplish this, SSA and IRS records are compared annually 
  in a process known as Annual Wage Reporting reconciliation. <br>
  If the FICA and Medicare wages reported to both agencies agree, no action is 
  necessary. If more wages are reported to the IRS than to SSA, employees' wages 
  may not be credited correctly in SSA's records. SSA examines these cases and 
  tries to resolve the difference without contacting the employer. When resolution 
  is unsuccessful or is not possible without employer assistance, SSA sends a 
  notice and questionnaire to the employer requesting the wage data needed to 
  resolve the case. If SSA does not receive a response after 120 days, it sends 
  the employer a second notice. If no response is received after the second notice, 
  the IRS is responsible for contacting the employer and may impose penalties. 
  <br>
  <br>
  If more wages are reported to SSA than to the IRS, the IRS investigates the 
  discrepancy to determine whether the employer underpaid the Social Security 
  tax. If so, the IRS will assess the additional tax due. <br>
  <br>
  MANAGEMENT OF THE DISABILITY PROCESS<br>
  <br>
  At the forefront of congressional and Agency concern is the timeliness of SSA's 
  disability decisions at the hearings adjudicative level. The average processing 
  time at the hearings level continues to increase-from 293 days in FY 2001 to 
  512 days as of July 2008. Additionally, the pending hearings workload continues 
  to increase.<br>
  At the end of August 2008, there were 767,595 hearing cases pending-up from 
  746,744 in FY 2007 and almost double the 392,387 cases in FY 2001.<br>
  Backlog of Hearing Requests. In his May 23, 2007 testimony to Congress, the 
  Commissioner of Social Security announced a plan to eliminate the backlog of 
  hearing requests and prevent its recurrence. The Commissioner's plan focused 
  on (1) compassionate allowances, (2) improving hearing office procedures, (3) 
  increasing adjudicatory capacity and (4) increasing efficiency with automation 
  and improved business processes. It will take time for these new initiatives 
  and additional resources to lead to a noticeable reduction in the backlog. As 
  we noted earlier, the pending workload of hearing requests in August 2008 was 
  actually greater than it was at the end of FY 2007. <br>
  <br>
  Compassionate Allowances. The compassionate allowances initiative seeks to identify 
  cases where the disease or condition is so consistently devastating that SSA 
  can presume the claimant is disabled once a valid diagnosis is confirmed. SSA 
  has been developing and expanding the use of automated screening tools to identify 
  the types of cases that fall under the compassionate allowances initiative. 
  SSA is also refining its rules, regulations, and listing codes to reflect current 
  advances in medical science.<br>
  <br>
  Improve Hearing Office Procedures. Reducing aged cases is one of the two initiatives 
  SSA has in place to improve hearing office procedures. Under this initiative, 
  SSA focused on eliminating the backlog of approximately 64,000 cases that would 
  be 1,000 days or older by September 28, 2007. By the end of FY 2007, SSA had 
  reduced the backlog of 1,000 day-old cases to just over 100 cases. In FY 2008, 
  SSA redefined aged cases as those that would be 900 days or older by September 
  26, 2008. At the beginning of FY 2008, there were over 135,000 cases that were 
  or would become 900 days or older by the end of the FY. As of July 2008, the 
  number of these aged cases was reduced to approximately 12,700. <br>
  <br>
  Increase Adjudicatory Capacity. SSA has seven initiatives aimed at increasing 
  adjudicatory capacity. One initiative is to improve administrative law judge 
  (ALJ) productivity. Under this initiative, the Chief ALJ requested that each 
  ALJ issue 500 to 700 dispositions per year. This initiative also addresses providing 
  ALJs with appropriate training to assist them with these workloads. Another 
  initiative is hiring new ALJs. In FY 2008, SSA hired 189 new ALJs. <br>
  <br>
  Increase Efficiency with Automation and Improved Business Process. SSA has 27 
  initiatives related to automation and business processes. One initiative is 
  transitioning to the electronic folder. Under this initiative, all State disability 
  determination services (DDS) and Office of Disability Adjudication and Review 
  (ODAR) offices have transitioned from processing disability claims using paper 
  folders to using electronic folders. Other initiatives in this area include 
  electronic case file assembly, electronic scheduling, centralized printing and 
  mailing, enhanced hearing office management information, and expanded use of 
  video hearings. <br>
  <br>
  We will continue to work with SSA as it proceeds with its initiatives. For example, 
  our February 2008 review of ALJs' caseload performance found that ODAR's ability 
  to process projected hearing requests and address the growing backlog of cases 
  will continue to be negatively impacted by the caseload performance of some 
  ALJs if their status quo performance levels continue. Accordingly, we recommended 
  that SSA establish a performance accountability process that allows ALJ performance 
  to be addressed when it falls below an acceptable level. <br>
  <br>
  Following issuance of our February 2008 report, Congressmen Michael McNulty 
  and Sam Johnson requested that we perform additional work on ALJ and hearing 
  office performance. We issued the results of our congressional work in August 
  2008, which reported that ALJs had varying levels of productivity (both high 
  and low productivity) for internalized reasons, such as motivation and work 
  ethic. We also reported factors that impacted ALJ and hearing office productivity 
  and processing times that are part of the case adjudication process. The factors 
  related to hearing office staff levels, hearing dockets, favorable rates, individual 
  ALJ preferences, Agency processes and DDS case development. In addition, at 
  the request of Senator Sherrod Brown, we assessed the organizational culture 
  at the DDS for approving and denying disability claims. Senator Brown's request 
  was precipitated by a media story that stated SSA maintained a &quot;culture 
  to deny&quot; disability claims. Based on our work, we found the weight of evidence 
  did not support the allegation that there is a &quot;culture to deny&quot; within 
  the DDSs. <br>
  <br>
  We also reviewed other hearing reduction initiatives. In our April 2008 review 
  of the Association of ALJ's training conference costs, we found the Agency was 
  supporting ALJ training as a way of improving ALJ productivity but could implement 
  better controls over expenditures and attendance by running such conferences 
  in-house. Our June 2008 report on the timeliness of medical evidence assessed 
  the availability of management information at the hearing office and national 
  levels to assist managers in monitoring timeliness trends. After we identified 
  an area where more accurate coding of hearing activity could improve the management 
  information, the Agency issued new guidance to hearing offices instructing them 
  on the proper use of these codes. <br>
  <br>
  Disability Fraud <br>
  <br>
  Fraud is an inherent risk in SSA's disability programs. Some unscrupulous people 
  view SSA's disability benefits as money waiting to be taken. A key risk factor 
  is individuals who feign or exaggerate symptoms to become eligible for disability 
  benefits. Another key risk factor is the monitoring of medical improvements 
  for disabled individuals to ensure those individuals who are no longer disabled 
  are removed from the disability rolls. <br>
  <br>
  We continue to work with SSA to address the integrity of the disability programs 
  through the Cooperative Disability Investigations (CDI) program. The CDI program's 
  mission is to obtain evidence that can resolve questions of fraud in SSA's disability 
  claims. The CDI program is managed in a cooperative effort between SSA's Offices 
  of Operations, Inspector General, and Disability Programs. Since the program's 
  inception in FY 1998 through July 2008, the 19 CDI units, operating in 17 States, 
  have been responsible for over $1 billion in projected savings to SSA's disability 
  programs and over $650 million in projected savings to non-SSA programs.<br>
  <br>
  In FY 2009, we plan to complete 21 reviews and begin 22 reviews in the Management 
  of the Disability Process challenge. <br>

  <br>
  ACCURACY OF SPECIAL DISABILITY WORKLOAD DECISIONS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA is accurately calculating windfall offset payments 
  pertaining to the Special Disability Workload (SDW). <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA administers the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and 
  SSI programs. The OASDI program provides benefits to qualified retired and disabled 
  workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of insured workers. The 
  SSI program provides payments to individuals who have limited income and resources 
  and who are either age 65 or older, blind or disabled. <br>
  <br>
  Section 1611 (e)(2) of the Act requires that SSI recipients also eligible for 
  OASDI file for those benefits. As of July 2007, SSA reported it had identified 
  approximately 252,000 Title XVI disability recipients who appeared to be insured 
  for, but were not receiving, Disability Insurance (DI) benefits. SSA categorizes 
  these individuals as SDW claimant cases. As of September 30, 2007, SSA had reported 
  an estimated SDW liability totaling about $1.3 billion. <br>
  <br>
  The windfall offset may apply to individuals due SSI and OASDI payments. The 
  windfall offset prevents a person from receiving a higher payment retroactively 
  than would have been received if benefits were actually paid in the month due. 
  Windfall offsets are calculated automatically and manually, respectively, by 
  SSA's systems and staff. <br>
  <br>
  CONTROLS OVER FLEXI-PLACE AND PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AT HEARING 
  OFFICES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess the controls over flexi-place and PII at SSA's hearing offices. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The flexi-place program provides staff and ALJs with more options for completing 
  their assignments. Hearing office staff is allowed to take claimants' case files 
  home to prepare the files for hearing. These case files contain claimant PII, 
  such as their SSN, name, address, earnings information, and medical history. 
  As such, management must ensure controls are in place to appropriately safeguard 
  claimants' PII and ensure necessary workloads are completed. <br>
  Although most case files are electronic, it is still possible for claimants' 
  PII to be lost, stolen, and/or used improperly. As such, the hearing offices 
  need to ensure that proper controls are in place and are followed to prevent 
  the loss or inadvertent disclosure of claimant PII to parties without a need 
  to know. <br>
  <br>
  Our audit of Onsite Security Control and Audit Reviews [OSCAR] at Hearing Offices 
  addressed the need to update the OSCAR Guide to include protection of sensitive 
  data. SSA commented it expected to revise the ODAR OSCAR protocol and guide 
  by December 31, 2007. This revision was to include an effort to protect sensitive 
  data. <br>
  <br>
  DISABILITY CLAIMS OVERALL PROCESSING TIMES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine SSA's average overall processing time for disability claims decided 
  by the DDSs, ALJs, Appeals Council and Federal Courts. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  In its Annual Performance Plan, SSA has Key Performance Measures for the average 
  processing times of (1) initial disability claims, (2) hearings and (3) Appeals 
  Council reviews. However, these measures do not cover the entire period it takes 
  to process a disability claim. <br>
  <br>
  To perform our audit, we obtained files of disability decisions that were made 
  in Calendar Year 2006. From these files, we identified <br>
  2,618,926 claimants with decisions made by DDSs, <br>
  480,529 claimants with decisions made by ALJs, <br>
  64,473 claimants with decisions made by the Appeals Council, and <br>
  8,102 claimants with decisions made by the Federal Courts. <br>
  We then randomly selected 275 sample cases from the DDS population and 100 sample 
  cases from each of the other populations- for a total of 575 cases. For each 
  case, we will measure the time from date of application to date of denial or 
  date all due benefits were paid and use these measurements to determine the 
  average overall processing time. We will also analyze data for Calendar Year 
  2007. <br>
  <br>
  DISABILITY IMPAIRMENTS ON CASES MOST FREQUENTLY REVERSED BY THE OFFICE OF DISABILITY 
  ADJUDICATION AND REVIEW <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To identify the impairments of initial disability cases most frequently reversed 
  by ODAR and evaluate the characteristics of these cases. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA faces a considerable challenge of processing a large backlog of requests 
  for hearings. There are over 760,000 cases pending at ODAR. Of the 2.8 million 
  initial decisions DDSs made in Calendar Year 2004, 1.7 million (63 percent) 
  were denials. Historically, approximately 40 percent of DDS denials are appealed 
  to ODAR, and ODAR reverses approximately 60 percent of those decisions. Therefore, 
  of the 1.7 million cases denied by DDSs in Calendar Year 2004, we expect 408,000 
  (24 percent) to be reversed by ODAR. <br>
  <br>
  The American people expect SSA's decisional process to be effective and efficient. 
  Since ODAR reverses a large percentage of DDS decisions, it is logical to believe 
  that favorable decisions should be issued earlier in the process. Specifically, 
  if DDS' were to issue favorable decisions on the types of cases that are most 
  often reversed by ODAR, not only would decisions to the claimants be expedited, 
  but SSA could conserve ALJ resources for the more complex cases that require 
  a hearing.<br>
  <br>
  DISABLED INDIVIDUALS HIDING SELFEMPLOYMENT INCOME <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To identify individuals who participated in self-employment activities while 
  receiving DI benefits but concealed the income by transferring it to another 
  individual. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA is responsible for maintaining accurate individual earnings records, including 
  wages and Self-Employment Income (SEI). Wages and SEI are posted to SSA's MEF 
  and are used to determine eligibility for retirement, survivors, disability, 
  and health insurance benefits as well as to calculate benefit amounts. Self-employed 
  individuals report SEI to the IRS on a Profit or Loss from Business (Schedule 
  C) and Self Employment Tax (Schedule SE) attached to a Federal Income Tax Form 
  1040. The IRS sends this SEI information to SSA where it is recorded on individuals' 
  earning records. <br>
  Reporting earnings under another individual's SSN could make an individual appear 
  to be eligible for Social Security disability benefits when he or she is actually 
  working. To receive disability benefits, individuals must not be able to engage 
  in substantial work activity. Because of this stipulation, individuals awarded 
  disability benefits under the DI program may be inclined to deliberately conceal 
  work by transferring the income to someone else.<br>
  <br>
  ELECTRONIC FILE ASSEMBLY &quot;EPULLING&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To (1) assess the results of SSA's ePulling pilot project and (2) determine 
  whether the assessment procedures are effective for deciding when ODAR's hearing 
  offices are ready to implement ePulling. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Most cases processed by hearing offices are fully electronic, and the case folders 
  are reviewed electronically. The electronic folder containing these documents 
  requires manual sorting/reordering and data entry to support the hearing office's 
  business process. Information must be examined and organized in a manner that 
  is useful to those reviewing the cases and to the ALJs hearing the cases. </p>
<p>EPulling is one of the Commissioner's initiatives to eliminate the hearings 
  backlog by increasing the efficiency of the case preparation process in the 
  electronic folder. The initiative involves developing customized software that 
  can extract page-level data, identify potential duplicates, classify documents 
  by type of evidence and date, sequentially number pages, and assist in the creation 
  of exhibit lists. This program will support preparation of electronic cases 
  for hearing. It is anticipated that ePulling will reduce the time it takes to 
  assemble folders and will allow staff to devote more time to file analysis and 
  development. <br>
  The ePulling software went into production on June 7, 2008 and was tested in 
  the Model Process Test Facility in Falls Church, Virginia. Subsequently, the 
  ePulling pilot was rolled out to hearing offices in Tupelo, Mississippi; St. 
  Louis, Missouri; Mobile, Alabama; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Richmond, Virginia, 
  as well as the National Hearing Center in Falls Church, Virginia. <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW UP: DISABLED TITLE II BENEFICIARIES WITH EARNINGS REPORTED ON THE MASTER 
  EARNINGS FILE <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA implemented the recommendations from our July 2004 
  report, Disabled Title II Beneficiaries with Earnings Reported on the Master 
  Earnings File. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Our 2004 audit found that SSA did not evaluate all earnings reported to the 
  MEF for disabled individuals receiving Title II benefits as of March 2002. We 
  estimated that approximately $1.37 billion in overpayments resulting from about 
  63,000 disabled beneficiaries' work activity was not identified. <br>
  We recommended that SSA (1) review cases where significant earnings are present 
  in the MEF and no determination had been made regarding trial work and/or Substantial 
  Gainful Activity (SGA); (2) ensure future earnings enforcements are adequately 
  controlled by management and resolved timely; (3) ensure earnings reported on 
  the MEF or disclosed on beneficiary-completed forms are evaluated when medical 
  continuing disability reviews (CDR) are performed or mailer CDR forms are received; 
  and (4) ensure earnings resulting in benefit increases are evaluated to determine 
  whether trial work activity and/or SGA were performed. <br>
  <br>
  HEARING OFFICE POSITION DESCRIPTIONS AND STAFF TRAINING <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To analyze hearing office position descriptions and determine necessary training 
  for hearing office staff due to technical changes associated with the electronic 
  folder. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  ODAR has over 5,000 staff in its 140 hearing offices to assist 1,100 ALJs. Staff 
  duties include (1) ordering updated medical information, (2) associating incoming 
  mail with the claim folder, (3) organizing the claimant's information in the 
  claim folder, (4) scheduling hearings, (5) updating the Case Processing and 
  Management System (CPMS), and (6) writing decisions. <br>
  <br>
  Hearing offices are implementing new information technology initiatives that 
  are transforming hearing office operations from paper-based claim folders to 
  the electronic processing of disability claims. The technology initiatives include 
  Electronic Disability Initiative; CPMS; Digital Recording; and Video Hearings. 
  <br>
  In March 2005, we issued a report on The Effects of Staffing on Hearing Office 
  Performance that stated hearing offices had difficulty retaining high-performing 
  staff. Once staff members are trained and become efficient in their duties, 
  they leave for higher paying positions in SSA. We also learned that many management 
  positions in hearing offices remained vacant for long periods of time because 
  the positions include greater duties for the same pay. Finally, ALJs stated 
  they were concerned that their support staff lacked requisite skills to properly 
  assist with backlogged cases. <br>
  <br>
  IMPROVED ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ALLEGED MISCONDUCT AND COMPLAINT PROCESS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA has established an effective process to address public 
  complaints alleging ALJ misconduct. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Since 1992, ODAR has offered a second method to voice complaints specifically 
  about ALJ bias, misconduct or unfair treatment by an ALJ, referred to as the 
  Public ALJ Misconduct Complaint Process. The Offices of General Counsel, the 
  Chief Administrative Law Judge (OCALJ), Appellate Operations, and Labor Management 
  and Employee Relations have been meeting to improve this complaint process. 
  The group's work involves changing notices, posters, associated pamphlets, and 
  the website that outlines how to file an unfair treatment complaint. The group 
  is also studying the process and considering improvements that will involve 
  regulatory changes. The goal is to make the ALJ complaint process both fair 
  and effective for SSA, the ALJs and the American people. The OCALJ has also 
  taken a more proactive stance in pursuing disciplinary actions based on ALJ 
  misconduct. <br>
  <br>
  LESSONS LEARNED FROM REMANDS TO DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To analyze the role of the remands to the DDSs in reducing the backlog and determine 
  whether this process has provided any lessons learned that can be applied in 
  the future. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The DDS informal remand initiative was developed to increase ODAR's adjudicatory 
  capacity and reduce the paper case backlog by requesting DDSs re-open certain 
  cases based on scoring profiles established by the Office of Quality Performance. 
  The DDSs agreed to review approximately 20,000 informal remands in FY 2007. 
  DDSs reviewed these cases, and if they were able to make a fully favorable determination, 
  they returned the cases to an SSA FO for adjudication. If the claimant did not 
  request to pursue the hearing within 30 days of notice of the revised DDS determination, 
  ODAR dismissed the hearing. If the DDS was not able to make a favorable determination, 
  the case was fully developed by the DDS and returned to ODAR. ODAR moved these 
  developed cases to the front of the queue for scheduling. According to SSA, 
  approximately 20,000 cases were sent to the DDSs in FY 2007, and another 51,000 
  were expected to be remanded to the DDSs in FY 2008. <br>
  <br>
  MEDICAL LISTINGS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess SSA's efforts to update the medical listings. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The medical listing is the third step in the Agency's sequential evaluation 
  process in determining whether a claimant is disabled. In August 2000, we issued 
  a report on SSA's updates to the medical listings and concluded that SSA should 
  make updating the medical listings a priority. In January 2007, GAO issued a 
  report, High-Risk Series: An Update, which put Federal disability programs, 
  including SSA's disability programs, on GAO's high-risk list for being outdated. 
  GAO noted that disability criteria have not been updated to reflect the current 
  state of science, medicine, technology, and labor market conditions. <br>
  <br>
  NATIONAL ROLLOUT OF THE QUICK DISABILITY DETERMINATION PROCESS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess the national rollout of the Quick Disability Determination (QDD) process. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The QDD process involves initial disability claims that are electronically identified 
  by a predictive model as involving a high potential that (a) the claimant is 
  disabled and (b) evidence of the claimant's allegations can be easily and quickly 
  obtained. QDD was piloted in the Boston Region, and we issued a report in May 
  2007 with suggestions for improving the process before national rollout. In 
  October 2007, SSA started rolling out the QDD process nationwide. <br>
  <br>
  QUICK RESPONSE EVALUATION: TITLE II CLAIMANTSWHOWERE DENIED DISABILITY BENEFITS 
  ANDWHOWERE DECEASEDWITHIN 1 YEAR <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether individuals who were denied disability benefits and were 
  subsequently deceased within 1 year should have been denied benefits. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Disability claimants must provide medical and, if asked, nonmedical evidence 
  to support their claims. Applications and nonmedical development are initiated 
  in the FO. Information provided by the claimant to the FO during the disability 
  interview is critical to the DDS' development of medical evidence. A claimant 
  whose disability claim has been denied may request a reconsideration of the 
  initial determination. Notice of a claimant's death after denial or cessation 
  of disability benefits may raise a question as to whether the prior determination 
  should be changed. <br>
  <br>
  REASONS FOR HEARING POSTPONEMENTS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine why more than 1 of every 10 hearings is postponed and rescheduled 
  and identify best practices at those hearing offices with the lowest volume 
  of postponements. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  ODAR uses the Auxiliary Monthly Activity Report to monitor the different types 
  of postponements in a hearing office. Postponements can relate to a number of 
  reasons, such as the claimant or claimant's representative being unavailable. 
  Our review of the FY 2007 postponement codes revealed 51,988 hearings were postponed.<br>
  <br>
  The Act provides the individual the option for benefit continuation through 
  the ALJ hearing level of appeal in medical cessation decisions. The option to 
  elect continued benefits also applies to auxiliaries receiving benefits on the 
  record of the primary disability beneficiary. Benefit payments made during the 
  appeals process are considered overpayments if the cessation decision is upheld. 
  As a result, hearing postponements can result in higher overpayments that SSA 
  must then recover. <br>
  <br>
  REDUCE AGED CASES AT THE HEARING LEVEL <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the age of cases in the backlog, identify potential bottlenecks 
  and areas for improvement, and recommend actions that can assist SSA in reducing 
  the aged case backlog. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Since FY 2001, hearing receipts have been increasing while the timeliness of 
  hearings processing has worsened, resulting in an increase in the number of 
  hearings pending. For example, pending claims were 392,387 in FY 2001 but increased 
  to over 762,000 in FY 2008. In addition, average processing time was 307 days 
  in FY 2001 but increased to 512 days by July 2008. <br>
  <br>
  As noted earlier, the Commissioner's initiative to reduce the number of older 
  cases focused on eliminating the backlog of aged cases that would be 1,000 days 
  or older by September 28, 2007. By the end of FY 2007, SSA had reduced the backlog 
  of 1,000 day-old cases to just over 100. In FY 2008, SSA redefined aged cases 
  as those that would be 900 days or older by September 26, 2008. At the beginning 
  of FY 2008, there were over 135,000 cases that were or would become 900 days 
  or older by the end of the FY. As of June 2008, the number of these aged cases 
  was reduced to approximately 20,000. <br>
  <br>
  Per SSA, the successful strategies to reduce the backlog included the following. 
  <br>
  Identification of national and regional coordinators who were in continuous 
  communication with the hearing offices to provide extensive oversight and closely 
  track the progress of reducing the number of aged cases. <br>
  <br>
  Inter-regional transfers authorized by the OCALJ to assist regions with permanent 
  case reassignment and decision writing. <br>
  Cooperative efforts between regional offices, FOs and DDSs to expedite consultative 
  examinations in aged cases. <br>
  Review and correction of ODAR workload status codes. <br>
  Update and correct claimants' addresses. <br>
  <br>
  ROLE OF TECHNICAL DENIALS IN THE DISABILITY EVALUATION PROCESS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To (1) identify the types of non-medical technical denials at all stages of 
  the disability evaluation process and (2) determine the percent/ratio of technical 
  denials issued for disability claims at each adjudicative level. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  A technical denial is a disability claim that is denied for a reason other than 
  an unfavorable medical decision. Technical denials include non-medical decisions, 
  such as excess income or resources for SSI applicants or lack of insured status 
  for Social Security applicants as well as medical decisions that were subsequently 
  denied for technical reasons.<br>
  <br>
  According to SSA's 2007 Annual Statistical Report on Social Security Disability 
  Insurance Program, there has been a sharp increase in the number of technical 
  denials related to DI claims. In 1999, there were 104,344 technical denials 
  (approximately 8.3 percent of 1,262,564 total claims adjudicated) and 528,636 
  technical denials in 2005 (approximately 30.2 percent of 1,749,271 total claims 
  adjudicated). From 1999 to 2005, SSA issued 2,160,441 technical denials for 
  DI claims at all adjudicative levels. <br>
  <br>
  ROTATION OF CLAIMS AMONG ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES AT HEARING OFFICES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether claims are assigned to ALJs on a rotational basis as stipulated 
  in ODAR's Hearings, Appeals and Litigation Law (HALLEX) manual. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  ODAR's HALLEX rotational policy is based on the Administrative Procedures Act. 
  ODAR has stated that the rotational policy is necessary to <br>
  ensure the appearance of fairness in that there is no pre-selection of ALJs 
  by the claimant and/or his or her representative; <br>
  distribute the workload evenly, thereby improving hearing office efficiency; 
  <br>
  adhere to the Agency's policy of public service; and <br>
  keep up office morale. <br>
  <br>
  In previous audit work, we learned hearing offices were not always following 
  the rotational policy. A review of hearing office rotation practices nationwide 
  may identify problematic trends that need to be resolved as well as best practices 
  that can be shared among hearing offices. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S DEFINITION OF DISABILITY <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess SSA's definition of disability. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Modernizing Federal disability programs is on GAO's high-risk list. GAO noted 
  that &quot;...SSA's and VA's disability programs are based on definitions and 
  concepts that originated over 50 years ago, despite scientific advances that 
  have reduced the severity of some medical conditions and have allowed individuals 
  to live with greater independence and function in work settings.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  Under SSA's disability program, an individual is considered disabled if he or 
  she is unable to engage in any SGA because of a medically determinable impairment 
  that <br>
  (1) can be expected to result in death or <br>
  (2) has lasted (or can be expected to last) for a continuous period of at least 
  12 months. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Advisory Board issued a report in October 2003 on SSA's 
  definition of disability. The Board concluded &quot;The Social Security disability 
  programs had their origins in the 1950s-a world vastly different from today's 
  world in several important respects including the nature of available work, 
  the educational levels of the workforce, medical capacity to treat disabling 
  conditions, and the nature and availability of rehabilitative technology. Over 
  the past half-century, there have been a number of changes in the disability 
  programs. But the core design of the program, rooted in a definition of disability 
  as inability to do substantial work, has remained unchanged.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S USE OF DEFAULT/UNDEFINED DIAGNOSIS CODES 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the appropriateness of using &quot;default/undefined&quot; disability 
  diagnosis codes. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The diagnosis code is an integral part of each disabled individual's permanent 
  record. This code on the Master Beneficiary (MBR) and Supplemental Security 
  Records should refer to the basic medical condition that rendered the individual 
  disabled. SSA uses the diagnosis code, along with other fields, for a variety 
  of purposes, such as determining what type of CDR will be performed. If the 
  original diagnoses was electronically available, SSA could better assess the 
  likelihood of medical improvement in profiling the case and thereby determine 
  the appropriate method of review. <br>
  <br>
  During recent audit work, we found disability records with default/undefined 
  diagnosis codes, such as 0001 (diagnosis unknown), 6490 (none established), 
  and 2480 (diagnosis established). A March 2000 report on the Reliability of 
  Diagnosis Codes Contained in the Social Security Administration's Data Bases 
  identified inefficiencies in this area that may still be present. <br>
  <br>
  USE OF VIDEO HEARINGS TO REDUCE THE HEARING CASE BACKLOG <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether ODAR's use of video hearings has increased the number of 
  hearings scheduled and heard, increased dispositions, minimized travel by ALJs, 
  reduced pending caseload, and decreased the processing time of hearings. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The use of video hearings allows ALJs to conduct hearings without being co-located 
  with the claimant and representative. Video hearings have the potential to reduce 
  processing times and increase productivity. In FY 2007, ODAR held approximately 
  45,000 hearings using video hearing equipment. SSA has installed 400 video hearing 
  units, most are at hearing offices and permanent remote sites. The Commissioner's 
  Backlog Initiative calls for another 158 units nationwide. </p>
<p>W-2 EARNINGS FOR INDIVIDUALS RELATED TO DISABLEDWORKERS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To identify DI beneficiaries hiding wages by using a relative's SSN. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA administers the DI to provide benefits to qualified disabled workers and 
  their dependents. An individual is considered disabled for the purposes of the 
  DI program if he/she cannot engage in SGA. SGA means the performance of significant 
  physical or mental activities in work for pay or profit or in work of a type 
  generally performed for pay or profit. <br>
  <br>
  Our Office of Investigations identified beneficiaries drawing DI benefits while 
  their spouses, according to wage information, began receiving pay in the same 
  positions the beneficiaries held before filing for disability benefits. The 
  investigations found beneficiaries were receiving DI benefits by concealing 
  wages earned under the SSNs of their spouses. <br>
  <br>
  IMPROPER PAYMENTS AND RECOVERY OF OVERPAYMENTS<br>
  <br>
  Workers, employers, and taxpayers who fund SSA and SSI programs deserve to have 
  their tax dollars effectively managed. Therefore, SSA must be a responsible 
  steward of the funds entrusted to its care and minimize the risk of making improper 
  payments. SSA strives to balance its service commitments to the public with 
  its stewardship responsibilities. However, given the size and complexity of 
  the programs the Agency administers, it is a certainty that some payment errors 
  will occur.<br>
  Since SSA is responsible for issuing timely benefit payments for complex entitlement 
  programs to millions of people, even the slightest error in the overall process 
  can result in millions of dollars in over- or underpayments. In FY 2007, SSA 
  issued over $612 billion in OASDI and SSI benefit payments to about 54 million 
  people. In January 2008, the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) report 
  on Improving the Accuracy and Integrity of Federal Payments noted that nine 
  Federal programs-including SSA's OASDI and SSI programs-accounted for over 90 
  percent of the improper payments in FY 2007. However, this report also noted 
  that the OASDI program had an almost $800 million reduction in improper payments 
  from the prior year. <br>
  <br>
  Curbing improper payments is one of SSA's strategic objectives. In addition, 
  Congress passed the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (Pub.L.No. 107-300), 
  and OMB issued implementing guidance that clarified the definition of an improper 
  payment and OMB's authority to require that agencies track programs with low 
  error rates (that is, less than 2.5 percent) but significant improper payment 
  amounts. <br>
  <br>
  SSA has been working to improve its ability to prevent over- and underpayments 
  by obtaining beneficiary information from independent sources sooner and using 
  technology more effectively. For example, SSA is continuing its efforts to prevent 
  payments after a beneficiary dies through the use of Electronic Death Registration 
  information. Also, the Agency's CDR process is in place to identify and prevent 
  beneficiaries who are no longer disabled from receiving payments. SSA tries 
  to achieve a balance between stewardship and service; however, it is a challenge 
  due to the funding needed for the Agency to conduct an adequate number of medical 
  and work-related CDRs. Although the Agency had special funding for CDRs in FYs 
  1996 through 2002 and SSA's data shows that CDRs save about $10 for every $1 
  spent to conduct them, the Agency has cut back on this workload. <br>
  <br>
  In March 2008, we issued a report that identified $7.6 million in overpayments 
  to auxiliary beneficiaries because SSA's records did not have their SSNs on 
  its payment records; and as a result, the Agency's data matching efforts did 
  not detect that these individuals were incorrectly paid. When we issued the 
  report, SSA had already recovered $3.1 million (41 percent) of the improper 
  payments. We also issued a report in May 2008 showing that an estimated 2,088 
  SSI recipients were overpaid about $24.8 million because they did not report 
  their marriages to SSA. As a result, SSA is taking corrective action to stop 
  the improper payments and collect the overpayments. <br>
  <br>
  We continue to work with SSA to address improper payments in its programs. For 
  example, in an April 2008 report, we determined that despite SSA's efforts to 
  identify residency violations, about $226.2 million in overpayments went undetected 
  because about 40,560 recipients did not inform SSA of their absence from the 
  United States. SSA agreed with our recommendation to obtain and analyze electronic 
  bank statement information to prevent these types of overpayments in the future. 
  In two other reports issued in 2008, we identified approximately $467 million 
  in underpayments owed to about 395,000 beneficiaries. <br>
  In FY 2009, we plan to complete 27 reviews and begin 36 reviews in the Improper 
  Payments and Recovery of Overpayments challenge. <br>
  <br>
  WE PLAN TO COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING REVIEWS IN FY 2009 <br>

  <br>
  BENEFICIARY OVERPAYMENTS NOT ESTABLISHED IN THE RECOVERY OF OVERPAYMENTS, ACCOUNTING 
  AND REPORTING SYSTEM <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA properly identifies and controls overpayments recorded 
  as Special Payment Amounts (SPA) on the MBR. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Overpayments recorded as SPA on the MBR must be established and recorded on 
  the Recovery of Overpayments, Accounting and Reporting (ROAR) System, which 
  controls the recovery and collection of all Title II overpayments until they 
  are repaid or resolved. SSA periodically identifies overpayments recorded as 
  SPA on the MBR to ensure they are properly established and controlled by the 
  ROAR System. <br>
  <br>
  A 1998 audit identified about $11.2 million in SPA overpayments in which no 
  actions had been taken to record them on the ROAR System. In addition, the audit 
  identified approximately $26.3 million in erroneous SPA overpayments recorded 
  on the MBR. <br>
  <br>
  BENEFIT PAYMENTS MAILED TO POST OFFICE BOXES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the appropriateness of multiple OASDI and/or SSI benefit payments 
  mailed to the same Post Office Box address. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  In January 2004, we were alerted to three cases where beneficiaries inappropriately 
  received benefits under multiple SSNs at the same address. In FY 2005, we issued 
  a report on Individuals Receiving Benefits under Multiple Social Security Numbers 
  at the Same Address. As part of that review, we obtained data identifying approximately 
  54 million OASDI and SSI beneficiaries/ recipients in current payment status. 
  Through analysis of the data, we identified hundreds of beneficiaries who received 
  benefits inappropriately under at least two different SSNs at the same address. 
  <br>
  <br>
  CONTROLS OVER CHANGES MADE TO DIRECT DEPOSIT ROUTING NUMBERS FOR TITLE II PAYMENTS 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the effectiveness of SSA's controls over changes to direct deposit 
  routing numbers for Title II payments. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA encourages beneficiaries to use direct deposit for their benefit payments. 
  As of June 2008, approximately 85 percent of all Title II payments were made 
  through direct deposit. When beneficiaries who use direct deposit change bank 
  accounts, they can call or visit an FO or call SSA's 800-number to request that 
  their payments be deposited into their new bank accounts. <br>
  <br>
  In the past, a small number of SSA employees has been caught redirecting beneficiary 
  payments to their own bank accounts. For example, an SSA employee from the Northeastern 
  Program Service Center and three accomplices were arrested and prosecuted for 
  redirecting tens of thousands of dollars in benefit payments from over a dozen 
  elderly and disabled beneficiaries. To help prevent such instances of fraud, 
  SSA has controls in place to ensure only appropriate changes are made to a beneficiary's 
  bank account information. <br>
  <br>
  CONTROLS OVER SUPPLEMENT SECURITY INCOME IMMEDIATE PAYMENTS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSI immediate payments were issued in compliance with SSA's 
  policies and procedures and resulting overpayments were properly recorded. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  When an SSI recipient is in dire need of immediate cash to pay living expenses, 
  staffs at SSA FOs are authorized to issue the individual an immediate payment. 
  SSI immediate payments are processed through the Modernized Supplemental Security 
  Income Claims System and should be recorded on the Supplemental Security Record. 
  When the immediate payment replaces a previously issued check or benefits withheld 
  to recover an overpayment, an overpayment should be recorded on the recipient's 
  record for the amount of the immediate payment. <br>
  <br>
  CREDIT INFORMATION FOR SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME RECIPIENTS WITH EXCESS INCOME 
  OR RESOURCES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA could use information from credit bureaus to identify 
  SSI recipients who may be receiving inaccurate SSI payments because of unreported 
  income and/or resources. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  In 1972, Title XVI of the Act established the SSI program to guarantee a minimum 
  level of income to financially needy individuals who are aged, blind or disabled. 
  The 2008 SSI Federal benefit rate for an eligible individual is $637. However, 
  the Federal benefit rate is reduced if an individual has countable income or 
  resources over the established limit. Large credit card or mortgage payments 
  could indicate the individual has income or resources from other sources that 
  are not being reported to SSA. <br>
  <br>
  DISCREPANCIES IN MEDICARE ENROLLMENT DATA ON SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 
  AND CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES RECORDS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA identifies and corrects discrepancies between SSA and 
  CMS Medicare enrollment data. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA maintains and updates health insurance-related entitlement, enrollment, 
  premium and third-party data for Medicare beneficiaries on the MBR. SSA provides 
  these data to CMS daily and monthly. CMS houses these data in its Enrollment 
  Database, Direct Billing System and Third Party System. <br>
  The Enrollment Database contains enrollment and entitlement information, as 
  well as demographic information, for each beneficiary. The Direct Billing System 
  maintains a record of all beneficiaries who are billed directly for their Medicare 
  premiums. The Third Party System contains information on Medicare beneficiaries 
  whose premiums are paid by third parties (for example, State Medicare Agencies 
  and the Office of Personnel Management). <br>
  <br>
  ESTABLISHMENT OF DEDICATED ACCOUNTS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine compliance with requirements to establish dedicated accounts. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Public Law 104-193, enacted August 22, 1996, requires that certain past-due 
  payments for SSI recipients under age 18 be placed in dedicated accounts. Dedicated 
  accounts are separately maintained from other accounts and may only be used 
  for certain expenditures. Only certain SSI underpayments may be deposited into 
  dedicated accounts. A dedicated account must be established when the applicable 
  past due SSI payment exceeds six times the maximum monthly benefit payable.<br>
  <br>
  The representative payee should establish the dedicated account before past-due 
  payments are paid. SSA, in turn, will deposit the past-due payments into this 
  account so the funds may be used for the beneficiary's allowable expenditures. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Allowable expenses must be related to the recipient's impairments and include 
  impairment-related expenses for medical treatment and education or job skills 
  training. Generally, the funds may not be used for non-impairment-related expenses, 
  including food, clothing, housing, and personal items. However, SSA may approve 
  use of dedicated account funds for basic living expenses to prevent a recipient 
  from becoming homeless or malnourished. <br>
  <br>
  FEDERAL EMPLOYEES RECEIVING FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION ACT AND DISABILITY 
  INSURANCE <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether Federal Employees' Compensation Act recipients are reporting 
  compensation received for lost wages that may impact their Title II disability 
  benefits. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The Act provides DI to beneficiaries under age 65. If the beneficiary also receives 
  public disability benefits, which includes Workers' Compensation, the DI benefit 
  may be reduced. The Act requires that disability benefits be reduced when the 
  worker is also eligible for periodic or lump-sum Workers' Compensation payments, 
  so the combined amount of Workers' Compensation and DI benefits does not exceed 
  80 percent of the worker's average current earnings. The combined payments after 
  the reduction, however, will never be less than the amount of DI benefits before 
  the reduction. <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW-UP: CONTROLS OVER RECORDING SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME OVERPAYMENTS 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA implemented the recommendations from our May 2001 report, 
  <br>
  Controls over Recording Supplemental Security Income Overpayments. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Our 2001 audit found that SSA's internal controls did not ensure all SSI overpayments 
  on closed records were identified and pursued for collection from payments. 
  As a result, we estimated that, as of February 2000, $93.5 million in overpayments 
  should have been transferred to 35,138 recipients' current records. Further, 
  we estimated that SSA could have already recovered $42.8 million in overpayments 
  from these recipients' benefit payments had the overpayments been transferred 
  to the newly established SSI records when their payments resumed. <br>
  <br>
  We recommended that SSA: <br>
  1. Continue to periodically run the Debt Recovery Program to ensure that prior 
  overpayments on closed records were identified and pursued for collection. <br>
  2. Pursue collection of the 17,675 overpayments we identified that did not meet 
  the criteria for selection by the Debt Recovery Program. <br>
  3. Review the 20,519 overpayments we identified that met the criteria for being 
  moved forward by the Debt Recovery Program and ensure these outstanding overpayments 
  were transferred to new SSI records. <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW-UP: CONTROLS OVER THE SUSPENSION OF COLLECTION EFFORTS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL 
  SECURITY INCOME OVERPAYMENTS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA implemented corrective actions in our prior review 
  and whether those changes improved controls over the suspension of collection 
  efforts for SSI overpayments. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  When an SSI recipient is overpaid, SSA can suspend collection of the debt when 
  a recipient is not in current payment status and previous collection efforts 
  have determined the individual is unable or unwilling to pay, cannot be located, 
  or is out of the country. Suspension decisions allow SSA to stop unproductive 
  collection efforts. Because a suspended overpayment is not waived or written 
  off as uncollectible, SSA has the option to initiate collection efforts at a 
  later date if a change in the debtor's status may lead to some collection of 
  the overpayment. <br>
  <br>
  We found that SSA staff did not always comply with the Agency's policies and 
  procedures to ensure decisions to suspend collection efforts on SSI overpayments 
  were appropriate. We estimated, for FY 2002 suspension decisions greater than 
  $3,000, that SSA personnel did not fully comply with policies and procedures 
  in 12,060 decisions totaling about $87.5 million. <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW-UP: PRISONER INCENTIVE PAYMENTS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA is paying the appropriate amount of incentive payments 
  to prisons for inmate data. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Our 2004 report, The Social Security Administration's Prisoner Incentive Payment 
  Program, found that SSA's procedures did not ensure that incentive payments 
  to institutions that provided inmate information were in accordance with the 
  provisions of the Act. We estimated that 86,131 incentive payments were issued 
  to institutions for $18.97 million that should not have been paid. SSA agreed 
  there was a discrepancy that needed to be resolved between the incentive payment 
  provisions included in the Act and how the Agency was paying incentive payments. 
  <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW-UP: THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S CONTROLS OVER THE OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS 
  AND DISABILITY INSURANCEWAIVER APPROVAL PROCESS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the extent to which SSA implemented recommendations from our February 
  2006 report, The Social Security Administration's Controls over the Old-Age, 
  Survivors and Disability Insurance Waiver Approval Process. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  When an overpayment occurs, it is SSA's responsibility to identify the overpayment 
  and pursue recovery of the debt. Beneficiaries can seek relief from repaying 
  an overpayment by requesting that SSA waive the debt. Generally, SSA policy 
  allows FO personnel to waive recovery of an overpayment if the person is without 
  fault, recovery would defeat the purpose of Title II of the Act, and/or if recovery 
  would be against equity and good conscience. <br>
  <br>
  Our prior audit found overpayments were waived when there were indications the 
  beneficiaries may have caused the overpayments and/or had the financial ability 
  to repay portions of the waived debt. Also, granting waiver approvals, SSA did 
  not comply with its waiver approval policies and procedures for overpayments 
  exceeding $500.<br>
  <br>
  The Agency agreed to: <br>
  Alert employees to follow policies and procedures when approving waivers for 
  OASDI overpayments that exceed $500. <br>
  Ensure required secondary review and sign-off occurs for waivers greater than 
  $2,000. <br>
  Remind employees to properly document all waiver approval decisions. <br>
  Determine whether employee training is needed, and if so, provide training necessary 
  to ensure compliance with Agency policies and procedures for granting OASDI 
  overpayment waivers for amounts exceeding $500. <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW-UP: TITLE XVI OVERPAYMENT WAIVERS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To follow up on recommendations from our report, The Social Security Administration's 
  Controls over the Title XVI Overpayment Waiver Process. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Our October 2004 report identified over $64 million in savings. We recommended 
  that SSA ensure employees (1) develop and maintain documentation for all waivers 
  to include recipients' request for waivers, (2) properly develop fault and financial 
  circumstances and discontinue the practice of granting waivers when development 
  is incomplete and (3) ensure waivers over $2,000 are reviewed by supervisors 
  before a decision becomes final. <br>
  <br>
  FORCE-DUE COMPUTATIONS OF SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PAYMENTS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA's internal controls are adequate to ensure the force-due 
  process for manual computations of SSI payments is calculated and reviewed in 
  accordance with SSA policies and procedures. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  When SSA's automated system cannot compute an accurate SSI payment, the payment 
  must be manually computed, and the system must be forced to pay the manually 
  computed amount (force-due cases). Designated employees may perform manual overrides 
  of system-calculated SSI payments. SSA policy requires review of all force-due 
  calculations. <br>
  <br>
  The system will use the manually computed amounts to pay benefits and determine 
  under- and overpayment amounts until the force-due amount is changed or the 
  record is terminated. In most cases, the force-due payment should be temporary, 
  and the forced record should be terminated as soon as automated processing is 
  possible.<br>
  <br>
  Benefits paid outside the system can be highly susceptible to error. If not 
  controlled carefully, these payments can cause significant overpayments or underpayments. 
  SSA conducted a review of a random sample of force-due cases that raised concerns 
  that these cases may not have received the proper level of attention and oversight.<br>
  <br>
  IMPROPER PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM UNRESOLVED DELAYED CLAIMS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA properly increases beneficiaries' payments after a 
  delayed claim has been denied or benefits terminated. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  When an initial claim for Title II benefits is processed but an entitlement 
  factor has not been resolved, the claim is placed in a delayed payment status. 
  The claimant is considered entitled when computing benefit payments for other 
  entitled beneficiaries. As such, the delayed payment status prevents overpayments 
  to other beneficiaries entitled on the account. <br>
  <br>
  SSA should make reasonable efforts to contact the delayed beneficiary to develop 
  the claim. If SSA cannot locate the delayed claimant or resolve the entitlement, 
  the delayed payment status must be changed to terminated or disallowed, and 
  benefits to other beneficiaries on the same record should be increased, excluding 
  the delayed claimant. </p>
<p>INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING MULTIPLE OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY INSURANCE 
  BENEFITS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To identify and quantify overpayments to individuals receiving multiple OASDI 
  benefits. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA administers the OASDI program under Title II of the Act. The program provides 
  monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers and their families and to survivors 
  of deceased workers. Individuals may be entitled to benefits based on several 
  workers' earnings simultaneously but may generally only be paid the higher of 
  the two. When a beneficiary becomes entitled to another, higher benefit, SSA's 
  policy is to stop issuing the lower benefit payment, thus preventing an overpayment 
  from occurring. <br>
  <br>
  PAYMENTS TO SPOUSES ELIGIBLE FOR HIGHER RETIREMENT BENEFITS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether beneficiaries receiving spousal benefits are eligible to 
  receive higher retirement benefits based on their own earnings history. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Individuals receiving spousal benefits may have also earned sufficient quarters 
  of coverage to be eligible for higher retirement benefits based on their own 
  earnings history. Their retirement benefits may be further increased for any 
  month in which they did not receive a monthly benefit after full retirement 
  age. The amount of the increase, referred to as a delayed retirement credit, 
  depends on the number of months an individual was at least full retirement age, 
  fully insured, and eligible for retirement benefits but did not receive a monthly 
  benefit. A delayed retirement credit is earned for each month beginning at full 
  retirement age up to age 70. <br>
  SSA notifies surviving spouses who are eligible for higher retirement benefits 
  at full retirement age and age 70; however, it does not send similar notices 
  to spouses who are eligible for higher retirement benefits. We estimate there 
  are approximately 123,000 individuals over age 70 receiving spousal benefits 
  who are eligible for higher retirement benefits on their own earnings record 
  because of earned delayed retirement credit and/or work credits. <br>
  <br>
  POTENTIAL OVERPAYMENTS DUE TO INCOMPLETE QUARTERLYWAGE DATA FROM THE OFFICE 
  OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess the completeness of quarterly wage data collected by OCSE and the 
  potential overpayments resulting from the absence of this information when determining 
  SSA benefits. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 
  (Pub. L. No. 104-193) authorized OCSE to design and build a large database known 
  as the National Directory of New Hires. The National Directory of New Hires 
  contains three sets of data: Quarterly Wage, New Hire, and Unemployment Insurance. 
  OCSE provides SSA access to the National Directory of New Hires to establish 
  or verify eligibility and/or payment amounts under the SSI and OASDI programs. 
  <br>
  <br>
  We have learned that a number of States provide incomplete name/SSN information 
  on their submissions, so SSA is unable to match the wage data with its records. 
  These incomplete matches could lead to significant overpayments in SSA's programs. 
  A prior Office of Quality Performance review determined that the OCSE/SSA match 
  in the SSI program produced $277 million in benefits during FY 2005 alone. <br>
  <br>
  RETROACTIVE TITLE II PAYMENTS TO RELEASED PRISONERS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether retroactive benefit payments issued to individuals shortly 
  after serving long prison sentences were valid. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA suspends Title II payments if a beneficiary is both convicted of a criminal 
  offense and confined to a penal institution for more than 30 continuous days. 
  SSA reinstates benefits if the beneficiary is officially released because of 
  completion of a sentence, parole or pardon or residing outside a penal institution 
  and doing so at no expense (other than the cost of monitoring) to the institution 
  or the penal system or to any agency to which the penal system has transferred 
  jurisdiction over the individual. An example of this situation is home confinement, 
  home monitoring, or tethering. <br>
  <br>
  A recent Office of Investigations case highlighted SSA system vulnerability 
  related to processing a resumption action for an incorrect Title II benefit 
  suspension. An FO service representative fraudulently issued retroactive Title 
  II benefits to an individual who had been incarcerated and was not eligible 
  to receive benefits for the time period the retroactive payments were paid. 
  <br>
  <br>
  SPOUSES TO WIDOW(ER)'S BENEFITS WHEN GOVERNMENT PENSIONS ARE INVOLVED <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether Government pension verifications and payment recalculations 
  were completed when auxiliary beneficiaries receiving payments as spouses had 
  their benefit status changed to widow(er)s. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The OASDI program provides monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers and 
  their families and to survivors of deceased workers. OASDI auxiliary benefit 
  payments are based on a percentage of the insured individual's primary insurance 
  amount. The maximum OASDI benefit an individual can receive as a spouse is 50 
  percent of the primary insurance amount. However, the maximum OASDI benefit 
  amount an individual can receive as a widow(er) is 100 percent of the decedent's 
  primary insurance amount.<br>
  <br>
  Government Pension Offset may apply to spouse and widow(er)'s OASDI benefits. 
  The Government Pension Offset provision reduces monthly benefits for spouses, 
  divorced spouses, and surviving spouses who receive a pension based on their 
  own government employment that did not result in FICA taxable wages. If two-thirds 
  of the Government pension payment is equal to or more than the OASDI benefit 
  payable, spouse or widow(er) OASDI benefits can be reduced to zero. SSA staff 
  is required to initiate an action to determine whether the change from &quot;spouse&quot; 
  to &quot;widow(er)&quot; status would result in an increase to the benefit payment 
  amount. If staff does not make this assessment, OASDI underpayments may occur. 
  <br>
  <br>
  STATUS OF TITLE XVI INSTALLMENT AGREEMENTS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the effectiveness of SSA's efforts to collect Title XVI overpayments 
  when an installment agreement has been made but not honored. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  In most cases, overpaid individuals are responsible for repaying the overpayments 
  to SSA. They may not be responsible for repaying when the overpayment was not 
  their fault. SSA prefers a full and immediate refund of overpayments. If a full 
  refund is not possible, SSA has a number of methods to recover an overpayment. 
  For example, if a benefit is payable to the individual, SSA may reduce the monthly 
  benefit to recover the overpayment. <br>
  <br>
  When benefit withholding is not possible and an overpaid person is unable to 
  make a full refund in a single payment, an individual can agree to refund the 
  overpayment through regular installment payments. In cases where a beneficiary 
  makes, but later fails to honor an installment agreement, SSA's policies describe 
  a number of steps SSA staff should take to contact the delinquent debtor. </p>
<p>If certain criteria are met, SSA can also recover delinquent overpayments through 
  options such as the Treasury Offset Program, which offsets any Federal payment, 
  such as a tax refund, due an overpaid individual and/or through garnishing the 
  wages of delinquent debtors. <br>
  <br>
  SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME ELIGIBILITY OF REFUGEES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the effectiveness of SSA's controls over determining the eligibility 
  for SSI of refugees, asylees, and other noncitizens in a refugee-like immigration 
  status. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  In general, to be eligible for SSI, a noncitizen must be in a qualified alien 
  category and meet an exception that permits eligibility for qualified noncitizens. 
  Noncitizens who are refugees, asylees, or in certain refugee-like categories 
  can receive SSI for a maximum of 9 years from the date status was granted. SSA 
  is responsible for considering eligibility under this time-limited rule if the 
  noncitizen does not meet one of the exception conditions. <br>
  If the noncitizen status remains the same, they will lose their SSI eligibility 
  under the 9-year rule. However, SSA may pay continued benefits if an aged recipient 
  entered the United States before August 22, 1996 and alleges disability in connection 
  with an appeal of the loss of SSI eligibility under this rule. <br>
  <br>
  SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME RECIPIENTSWHO MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR DEPARTMENT OFVETERANS 
  AFFAIRS BENEFITS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSI recipients should be receiving VA benefits instead 
  of SSI. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  In Calendar Year 2008, we were alerted to a group of SSI recipients who appeared 
  to be eligible for VA benefits. SSI is a needs-based program that is intended 
  to be a program of last resort. Therefore, it is important to assess all other 
  benefit programs for which an individual is eligible based on his/her activities 
  or based on indirect qualification through family circumstances. According to 
  SSA guidelines, an individual is not eligible for SSI if he/she fails to apply 
  for all other benefits, such as VA benefits, for which he/ she may be eligible. 
  <br>
  <br>
  SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME RESOURCES-VEHICLES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the accuracy of SSA's determinations of SSI recipients' resources 
  related to vehicle ownership. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA considers an applicant or recipient's resources when determining eligibility 
  for the program. SSA policy requires exclusion as a resource the value of one 
  vehicle per family, regardless of its value. Additional vehicles are considered 
  non-liquid resources, and their value is generally counted as a resource. The 
  value of additional vehicles can be excluded as a resource if they are used 
  as property essential to self-support or a plan to achieve self-support, or 
  if the applicant/ recipient made a disposal agreement with SSA. While automobiles 
  are often the vehicle in question, other vehicles, like boats and recreational 
  vehicles, can be counted as resources. <br>
  When determining whether an applicant or recipient is eligible for SSI based 
  on their resources, SSA staff generally relies on an individual's allegation 
  of the resources they own. If SSA staff suspect an individual is providing inaccurate 
  information, they may ask for additional information from the individual and/or 
  further investigate the allegations provided. To help investigate allegations 
  of vehicle ownership, SSA staffs in 30 States have access to the vehicle ownership 
  information in the LexisNexis Risk Management Solutions Database (LexisNexis). 
  LexisNexis vehicle ownership information is limited to 30 States because of 
  the varying State laws on public access to vehicle ownership records.<br>
  <br>
  A study conducted in 2005 by SSA's Office of Quality Performance found that 
  less than 20 percent of the SSI recipients reported their vehicle ownership, 
  while another study published in the Access Almanac in 2002, Travel Patterns 
  Among Welfare Recipients, reported that 55 percent of welfare recipients own 
  an automobile. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S GOVERNMENT PURCHASE CARD PROGRAM <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA's oversight of its Government Purchase Card program 
  is effective. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The Purchase Card program was created as a way for agencies to streamline Federal 
  acquisition processes by providing a low-cost, efficient vehicle for obtaining 
  goods and services directly from vendors. SSA began participating in the Government 
  Purchase Card program in 1988. <br>
  <br>
  The Department of Commerce initially implemented the program and awarded a contract 
  to U.S. Bank for 10 years. In 1998, the General Services Administration awarded 
  Master Contracts to five banks under its SmartPay Program for another 10 years. 
  These contracts required that each bank provide commercial electronic access 
  system products and services to all agencies that issue them orders. In November 
  1998, the Agency issued a task order to Citibank that covers these services. 
  SSA reported that purchase card use increased from about $47 million in FY 1999 
  to almost $81 million in FY 2007. Further, the Agency indicated the number of 
  cardholders ranged between 2,800 and 3,000 at any given time during these FYs. 
  <br>
  <br>
  TITLE II BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE NUMIDENT RECORD CONTAINS A DEATH 
  ENTRY <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the appropriateness of benefits paid to individuals whose Numident 
  record contains a date of death. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Section 205(r) of the Act requires that SSA match States' death records against 
  SSA payment records to identify and prevent erroneous payments after death. 
  In addition, SSA matches death records from other Federal, State and local public 
  assistance agencies. SSA posts a person's date of death to its Numident record 
  and uses the Death Alert, Control, and Update System (DACUS) to receive and 
  process death information. The purpose of DACUS is to ensure that all benefits 
  to deceased beneficiaries are terminated appropriately and produce a national 
  record of death information, known as the DMF. However, prior audits and investigations 
  have found that in some cases, SSA erroneously continues to pay benefits after 
  death. <br>
  <br>
  UNPROCESSED ANNUAL EARNINGS ENFORCEMENT SELECTIONS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess SSA's progress in resolving a backlog of approximately 2.5 million 
  Earnings Enforcement selections and quantify the amount of improper payments 
  for the affected beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Social Security benefits are intended to replace, in part, earnings an individual 
  or family loses because of retirement, disability, or death. SSA uses the Annual 
  Earnings Test to measure the extent of a beneficiary's retirement and determine 
  the amount to be deducted from their monthly benefits. Beneficiaries who are 
  younger than full retirement age and who earn an amount in wages, self-employment 
  income, or both over the annual exemption amount receive reduced benefits. To 
  ensure compliance with the Annual Earnings Test, SSA compares the earnings posted 
  to the MEF with the earnings the beneficiary reported. This process, called 
  the Earnings Enforcement Operation, is designed to detect over- or underpayments 
  that may have occurred during the year. <br>
  <br>
  In our 2007 audit of the Annual Earnings Test, we found that for Calendar Years 
  2002 through 2004 SSA overpaid about $313 million to 89,300 beneficiaries and 
  underpaid about $35 million to 12,800 beneficiaries. In addition, we found that 
  SSA had not processed approximately 2.5 million Earnings Enforcement selections 
  for Calendar Years 1996 through 2005. Finally, we recommended that SSA review 
  and process, as appropriate, all Earnings Enforcement Operation selections pending 
  since 1996. <br>
  <br>
  INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT<br>
  <br>
  Sound management of public programs includes effective internal control. Internal 
  control comprises the plans, methods and procedures used to meet missions, goals 
  and objectives. SSA management is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
  internal controls to achieve the objectives of effective and efficient operations, 
  reliable financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
  Similarly, SSA management is responsible for determining whether the programs 
  it manages achieve intended objectives.<br>
  <br>
  OMB Circular A-123, Management's Responsibility for Internal Control, requires 
  that SSA develop and implement cost-effective internal controls for results-oriented 
  management. Internal controls are important when SSA works with third parties 
  to help complete its important workloads. For example, disability determinations 
  under DI and SSI are performed by DDSs in each State. DDSs are responsible for 
  determining claimants' disabilities and ensuring adequate evidence is available 
  to support its determinations. SSA reimburses the DDS for 100 percent of allowable 
  expenditures up to its approved funding authorization. We conduct audits of 
  state DDSs to ensure the costs they claimed are allowable and the DDSs have 
  proper internal controls over the accounting and reporting of the administrative 
  costs SSA reimburses.<br>
  <br>
  From FYs 2000 through 2008, we conducted 72 DDS administrative cost audits. 
  In 40 of the 72 audits, we identified internal control weaknesses and nearly 
  $115 million in questioned costs and/or funds that could be put to better use. 
  We believe the large dollar amounts claimed by State DDSs and the control issues 
  we have identified warrant that this issue remain a major management challenge. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Another area that involves third parties and requires effective internal controls 
  is the selection and oversight of contractors. Contracting is increasingly seen 
  as an effective way of supporting Federal agencies in managing increasing workloads 
  with diminished levels of staff. In FY 2007, SSA spent over $807 million on 
  contracts. We will review multiple contracts in FY 2009 to ensure SSA is getting 
  the services for which it is paying and has proper internal controls in place 
  to ensure effective oversight of contractors. Additionally, we will review a 
  number of the grants SSA provides for research and demonstration efforts involving 
  the OASDI and SSI programs. <br>
  <br>
  Effective controls are critical to the accuracy and efficiency of daily operations. 
  Internal control applies to program, operational, and administrative areas. 
  In addition to DDS, contract and grant audits, we will review internal controls 
  in a variety of areas. For example, we plan to review the accuracy of SSA's 
  garnishments of Title II benefits by SSA's court-ordered garnishment system, 
  the use of funding provided to SSA as part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 
  (Pub. L. No. 110-185), and SSA's collection of backup withholding taxes from 
  vendors. <br>
  <br>
  We plan to complete 20 reviews and begin 22 reviews in the Internal Control 
  Environment challenge. <br>
  <br>
  WE PLAN TO COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING REVIEWS IN FY 2009 Accuracy of the Garnishment

  ACCURACY OF THE GARNISHMENT OF TITLE II BENEFITS BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S 
  COURT-ORDERED GARNISHMENT SYSTEM <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether the system accurately <br>
  (1) calculates the allowable garnishment amount and (2) documents payment amounts 
  to third parties and State child support enforcement agencies. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Section 207 of the Act states that no benefits paid under Title II of the Act 
  &quot;. . . shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or 
  other legal process&quot; except by a provision of law that &quot;. . . does 
  so by express reference to&quot; section 207. Section 459(a) of the Act contains 
  such a specific exception. Pursuant to this section, Title II benefits are subject 
  to legal process brought by an individual in a State court for the enforcement 
  of a legal obligation to provide child support and/or make alimony payments. 
  Title XVI payments are not subject to levies or garnishment. <br>
  <br>
  To assist with this process, SSA has implemented the Court-Ordered Garnishment 
  System. This national System automates withholding from beneficiaries in compliance 
  with State or court-ordered garnishment requests. The System adjusts Title II 
  benefits, issues payments to the appropriate payee as designated in the garnishment 
  order and issues appropriate notices to the garnished beneficiary and the Court. 
  The Court-Ordered Garnishment System limits the garnishment amount to the lesser 
  of the State maximum or the maximum under the Consumer Credit Protection Act 
  and is based on the law of the State where the beneficiary resides. <br>
  <br>
  ACCURACY OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S FEDERAL PROCUREMENT DATA SYSTEM 
  - NEXT GENERATION DATA <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the accuracy of SSA's Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation 
  (FPDS-NG) data submission certification. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  FPDS-NG is a computer-based data system for collecting, developing, and disseminating 
  procurement data. FPDS-NG contains data the Government uses to create reports 
  for the President, Congress, GAO, Federal executive agencies and the public. 
  It is important that data contained in FPDS-NG be accurate, complete and timely. 
  SSA formed a workgroup in March 2007 to improve and maintain the quality of 
  data entered into FPDS-NG. <br>
  The accuracy of FPDS-NG is directly related to implementation of the Federal 
  Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. No. 109-282), which 
  requires a single, searchable website, publicly accessible for free, that includes 
  for each Federal award <br>
  the name of the entity receiving the award; <br>
  the amount of the award; <br>
  information on the award including transaction type, funding agency, etc; <br>
  the location of the entity receiving the award; and <br>
  a unique identifier for the entity receiving the award. <br>
  USAspending.gov opened in December 2007 as a result of the Transparency Act. 
  <br>
  <br>
  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS CLAIMED BY THE ARIZONA, KENTUCKY, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA 
  AND UTAH DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES (5 REVIEWS) <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To (1) evaluate the DDS' internal controls over the accounting and reporting 
  of administrative costs, (2) determine whether costs claimed by the DDS were 
  allowable and funds were properly drawn, and (3) assess limited areas of the 
  general security controls environment. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Disability determinations under both DI and SSI are performed by an agency in 
  each State in accordance with Federal regulations. In carrying out its obligation, 
  each State agency is responsible for determining the claimants' disabilities 
  and ensuring that adequate evidence is available to support its determinations. 
  <br>
  <br>
  CONTRACT AUDITS (4 REVIEWS) <br>
  <br>
  Abt Associates, Inc.-This contract is to develop the design of a multi-site, 
  demonstration project that tests alternate methods of treating work activity 
  in the Title II program. The contract period is September 30, 2004 to June 30, 
  2007. The total value of the contract is $5.5 million. <br>
  <br>
  Lockheed Martin Government Services, Inc.-This contract provides for medical 
  records and non-medical evidence, along with related data transmission and document 
  control services, to be digitally imaged (scanned). The cost of the services 
  over the 5-year period is estimated at about $125 million. <br>
  <br>
  MDRC-This contract is for program review/development services to test the impact 
  of providing immediate cash benefits and Medicare to Title II applicants. This 
  is a 5-year contract with a period of performance from January 2006 through 
  January 2011. With contract modifications, the total contract award to date 
  is about $42.9 million. <br>
  <br>
  Virginia Commonwealth University-This audit will provide SSA's contracting officer 
  with the cost information necessary to determine the final value of the contract 
  to use in closing the contract. The total value of the contract is about $1.9

  <br>
  FISCAL YEAR 2008 FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUDIT OVERSIGHT <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To fulfill our responsibilities under the Chief Financial Officers Act (Pub. 
  L. No. 101-576) and related legislation for ensuring the quality of the audit 
  work performed, we will monitor PricewaterhouseCoopers' audit of SSA's financial 
  statements. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The Chief Financial Officers Act requires that agencies annually prepare audited 
  financial statements. Each agency's Inspector General is responsible for auditing 
  these financial statements to determine whether they provide a fair representation 
  of the entity's financial position. This annual audit also includes an assessment 
  of the agency's internal control structure and its compliance with laws and 
  regulations. The audit work to support this opinion of SSA's financial statement 
  will be performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. We will monitor the contract to 
  ensure reliability of PricewaterhouseCoopers' work to meet our statutory requirements 
  for auditing the Agency's financial statements. <br>
  <br>
  FISCAL YEAR 2008 INSPECTOR GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S 
  MAJOR MANAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE CHALLENGES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To provide a summary and assessment of the most serious management and performance 
  challenges facing SSA in FY 2008. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 (Pub. L. No. 106-531) requires that Inspectors 
  General provide a summary and assessment of the most serious management and 
  performance challenges facing Federal agencies and the agencies' progress in 
  addressing them. This document responds to the requirement to include this statement 
  in SSA's FY 2008 Performance and Accountability Report. <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW-UP: THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S PROCEDURES FOR ADDRESSING EMPLOYEE-RELATED 
  ALLEGATIONS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the extent to which SSA implemented certain recommendations from 
  a series of reports on employee-related allegations we issued during FYs 2004 
  and 2005. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Employee-related allegations can originate from various sources, including SSA 
  employees, the public, congressional inquiries, internal security reviews, or 
  the Office of the Inspector General. These allegations are referred to the Offices 
  of the Regional Commissioners and/or SSA Headquarters components for review. 
  <br>
  Examples of employee-related allegations include standards of conduct violations; 
  ethics violations; potential criminal violations; the theft of Government property; 
  or allegations of rude, discourteous, or poor service where a specific employee 
  is named. Allegations concerning SSA employees are significant because of the 
  potential losses to SSA's programs and the corresponding negative impact on 
  the public. <br>
  <br>
  During FYs 2004 and 2005, we issued 11 reports on SSA's procedures for addressing 
  employee-related allegations. In each report, we discussed the applicable components' 
  management of employee-related allegations. In our reports, we frequently recommended 
  the component <br>
  implement a control system to document receipt, development, and disposition 
  of allegations; <br>
  retain documentation related to employee-related allegations; and <br>
  refer potential criminal violations to the Office of the Inspector General for 
  investigation. <br>
  <br>
  HOMELESS OUTREACH PROJECTS AND EVALUATION <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To evaluate the results of the Homeless Outreach Projects and Evaluation (HOPE). 
  <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Congress provided $8 million annually in FYs 2003 through 2005 directing SSA 
  to conduct outreach to homeless and other under-served populations. SSA used 
  this earmarked funding to establish HOPE in support of the initiative to end 
  chronic homelessness within 10 years. The HOPE initiative is focused on assisting 
  eligible, homeless individuals in applying for SSI and DI benefits. The HOPE 
  project will help SSA demonstrate the effectiveness of using skilled medical 
  and social service providers to identify and engage homeless individuals with 
  disabilities as well as assist them with the application process. Arizona, California, 
  Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, 
  Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, 
  Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin were involved in this project. 
  <br>
  <br>
  These grantees were required to provide outreach, supportive services and benefit 
  application assistance to homeless adults and children. In addition, HOPE grantees 
  may have performed optional activities that included presumptive disability 
  screening for SSI applicants; pre-release assistance for institutionalized individuals 
  with disabilities; representative payee services; employment interventions and/or 
  the use of electronic services to file for benefits. <br>
  <br>
  INDIRECT COSTS CLAIMED BY THE TEXAS DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether the indirect costs claimed by the Texas DDS for Federal 
  FYs 2006 and 2007 were allowable and properly allocated. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  State agencies determining disabilities for SSA are subject to regulations set 
  forth by OMB Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal 
  Governments. OMB Circular A-87 establishes basic guidelines for both direct 
  and indirect costs, setting the criteria as to whether a cost is allowable, 
  reasonable, and allocable. It further defines indirect costs and states that 
  indirect cost pools should be distributed to the benefited cost objectives on 
  bases that will produce an equitable result in consideration of the relative 
  benefits derived. <br>
  <br>
  SSA pays the Texas Department of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services, the 
  parent agency, indirect costs associated with providing support to the Texas 
  DDS. The U.S. Department of Education, as the cognizant agency, has negotiated 
  the indirect cost rate of all federally funded programs under the Texas Department 
  of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services. Indirect costs claimed by Texas Department 
  of Assistive and Rehabilitative Services for FYs 2006 and 2007 totaled approximately 
  $12.5 million and $11.6 million, respectively. <br>
  <br>
  QUICK RESPONSE EVALUATION: ABSENT WITHOUT LEAVE IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine the number of hours SSA employees are Absent Without Leave annually 
  and the controls management has in place to recognize and respond when an employee 
  is Absent Without Leave. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  On August 21, 2008, Senator Tom Coburn, M.D., released a report, Missing in 
  Action, AWOL in the Federal Government, which documents 18 Federal agencies 
  whose employees were Absent Without Leave about 19.6 million hours. The investigation 
  found that the number of Absent Without Leave hours increased from approximately 
  2.5 million in 2001 to 3.5 million in 2007. SSA was not mentioned in Senator 
  Coburn's report. <br>
  <br>
  QUICK RESPONSE EVALUATION: FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE BASIC SECURITY FEES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To (1) review the statutory authority of DHS' Federal Protective Service to 
  charge SSA a basic user fee and (2) determine whether current charges are correct 
  and appropriate. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The Federal Protective Service is the law enforcement program within DHS responsible 
  for the security of General Services Administration-owned or leased Federal 
  buildings and grounds, and the persons occupying them. Federal Protective Service 
  is 100 percent reimbursable and must collect the costs of providing law enforcement 
  and security services from the Federal agencies receiving this support. <br>
  <br>
  Public Law 110-161, signed December 26, 2007, directed the Federal Protective 
  Service to increase its staffing to 1,200 personnel to protect and enforce laws 
  at Federal buildings, including 900 law enforcement personnel. This requires 
  that the Federal Protective Service hire an additional 150 law enforcement officers 
  above its current staffing levels. To comply with the law, the Federal Protective 
  Service must increase its operating budget and will hire 150 new officers in 
  FY 2008 to bring Federal Protective Service's total law enforcement office staffing 
  to 900. Since the Federal Protective Service is entirely fee-funded, it must 
  recoup these additional costs through a mid-year fee increase. The law directs 
  the Secretary of DHS to adjust the fees to generate the necessary revenue to 
  fund the increase in personnel. Therefore, this unfunded congressional mandate 
  requires DHS to raise the basic security fee levels in FYs 2008 and 2009. <br>
  <br>
  UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN RETIREMENT RESEARCH CENTER <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To evaluate the results of the University of Michigan Retirement Research Center 
  cooperative agreement. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA awarded approximately 210 grants and cooperative agreements in FY 2007 for 
  about $39 million. The largest grantee was the University of Michigan Retirement 
  Research Center, which received $2.6 million in FY 2007. The University of Michigan 
  is part of SSA's Retirement Research Consortium. The Consortium consists of 
  three multidisciplinary centers in Boston College, the University of Michigan, 
  and the National Bureau of Economic Research and is funded through cooperative 
  agreements with SSA. SSA awarded the Consortium approximately $5 million in 
  2003 when the current 5-year award was made. When the award was made, funding 
  was expected to continue at that level or higher for each of the remaining years 
  of the award. <br>
  <br>
  YOUTH TRANSITION DEMONSTRATION PROJECT <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To evaluate the results of the Youth Transition Demonstration Project. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The States developed service delivery systems to assist youth with disabilities 
  to successfully transition from school, which may include post-secondary education, 
  to employment and economic self-sufficiency. The States established partnerships 
  to improve employment outcomes for youth age 14-25 who receive SSI or DI payments 
  based on their own disability. The projects provide transition-related services 
  and support. <br>
  <br>
  To further the New Freedom Initiative goal of increasing employment of individuals 
  with disabilities, SSA created the Youth Transition Demonstration. The Youth 
  Transition Demonstration began in 2003 with seven projects in six States. A 
  national evaluation contract was awarded to Mathematica Policy Research in September 
  2005. The obligated amount is $19.6 million. California, Colorado, Florida, 
  Maryland, Mississippi, New York, and West Virginia are currently involved. Iowa, 
  Vermont, Washington and one site in Maryland were previously involved in the 
  project, but these projects ended in 2007. <br>
  <br>
  Youth participating in the evaluation will be monitored for at least 4 years 
  after they are recruited into the study. A variety of data sources, surveys 
  of youth, and interviews with project staff will be used to determine whether 
  the intervention led to increased earnings or increased enrollment in postsecondary 
  education for youth. The evaluation uses a random assignment design, similar 
  to a lottery or picking names from a hat. Eligible youth are randomly chosen 
  to either receive Youth Transition Demonstration services or be in the control 
  group. Any differences in outcomes that emerge are attributed to the intervention. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The Youth Transition Demonstration is generating empirical evidence, based on 
  process and random-assignment evaluations, on the impacts of SSI waivers and 
  enhanced coordination of services for youth with disabilities. Under this project, 
  SSA is testing the effectiveness of altering certain SSI rules as an incentive 
  to encourage beneficiaries to initiate work or increase their work activity 
  and to increase their earnings.<br>
  <br>
  SYSTEMS SECURITY AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION<br>
  <br>
  Federal agencies maintain significant amounts of personal information concerning 
  individuals, known as personally identifiable information (PII). The loss of 
  PII can result in substantial harm, embarrassment, and inconvenience to individuals 
  and may lead to identity theft or other fraudulent use of the information. Agencies 
  have a duty to protect PII from loss and misuse.<br>
  <br>
  The vulnerability of critical infrastructures and the unique risks associated 
  with networked computing have been recognized for some time. Federal agencies 
  rely heavily on information technology to run their daily operations and deliver 
  products and services. With an increasing reliance on information technology, 
  a growing complexity of Federal information technology infrastructure, and a 
  constantly changing information security threat and risk environment, information 
  security has become a mission-essential function. <br>
  <br>
  SSA's information security challenge is to understand and mitigate system vulnerabilities. 
  Weaknesses in controls over physical and logical access to its electronic information, 
  technical security configuration standards, suitability and continuity of systems 
  operations have been identified. The information security challenge extends 
  the Agency's ability to properly maintain its operations and recover from a 
  disaster. While many of these weaknesses have been resolved, SSA needs to monitor 
  these issues diligently to ensure that they do not recur. This means ensuring 
  the security of its critical information infrastructure and sensitive data. 
  Federal agencies maintain significant amounts of personal information concerning 
  individuals, known as PII. <br>
  <br>
  Incidents of Federal agencies losing PII demonstrate the importance of data 
  security. The public will be reluctant to use electronic access to SSA services 
  if it does not believe the Agency's systems and data are secure. Without due 
  diligence, sensitive information can become available to those who are not entitled 
  to it and may use it for personal gain. For example, in June 2008, we reported 
  that since January 2004, the publication of the Death Master File (DMF) has 
  resulted in the breach of PII for over 20,000 living individuals erroneously 
  listed as deceased on the DMF. To address increasing workloads and the changing 
  work environment, SSA constantly assesses and implements new technologies, such 
  as the Internet Protocol version 6 and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). 
  New technology often brings advantages, but also presents new security challenges. 
  SSA needs to understand and address potential risks before such technology is 
  implemented. <br>
  SSA addresses critical information infrastructure and systems security in a 
  variety of ways. For example, it created a Critical Infrastructure Protection 
  workgroup that works toward compliance with various directives, such as the 
  Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) and the Federal Information 
  Security Management Act of 2002 (Pub. L. No. 107-347) (FISMA). HSPD 12 mandates 
  the development of a common identification standard for all Federal employees 
  and contractors. Federal Information Processing Standard 201, Personal Identity 
  Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors, was developed to satisfy 
  the requirements of HSPD 12. SSA worked with other agencies and OMB to address 
  HSPD 12 and comply with Personal Identity Verification. To date, SSA has issued 
  more than 63,000 Personal Identity Verification compliant credentials to employees 
  and contractor personnel and is on target to issue credentials to all 85,000 
  employees by September 30, 2008. <br>
  <br>
  To meet FISMA requirements, SSA and the Office of the Inspector General annually 
  evaluate SSA's security program. FISMA requires that agencies institute a sound 
  information security program and framework. Since the inception of FISMA, we 
  have worked with the Agency to ensure prompt resolution of security issues. 
  The House Government Reform Committee rated SSA &quot;A+&quot; for FY 2007 on 
  its computer security based on its compliance with the OMB FISMA reporting guidance. 
  This guidance requires that Federal agencies report on the status of certain 
  elements of their information security programs. However, reporting under these 
  criteria does not ensure a lack of system security deficiencies. <br>
  <br>
  Even though SSA is substantially compliant with the OMB FISMA guidance, there 
  are a number of system security areas that the Agency could improve upon. SSA 
  needs to ensure (1) controls to protect PII are fully developed and implemented 
  in accordance with OMB guidance; (2) adequate incident response and reporting 
  policies and procedures are implemented Agencywide; (3) system access controls 
  are fully implemented to meet least privilege criteria for all users of SSA 
  systems; (4) systems are sufficiently tested to fully meet FISMA requirements; 
  and (5) the suitability of all contractor personnel is appropriately tested 
  and such personnel receive annual security awareness training. <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, SSA has taken numerous steps in the area of PII. The Agency has 
  established workgroups: a PII Executive Steering Committee, which provides oversight 
  and recommendations on SSA policy; and the PII Breach Response Group whose role 
  is to engage in Agency planning in the event a breach occurs. SSA has developed 
  strict policies and procedures for employees to protect PII. In May 2008, SSA 
  began notifying the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team that individuals 
  were erroneously included in the DMF. SSA is also completing an assessment of 
  the risks involved with the affected individuals and developing an appropriate 
  notification policy for these individuals. Because of the critical nature of 
  PII, we plan to audit SSA's compliance with its own PII polices in the coming 
  Fiscal Year. <br>
  <br>
  SSA's sensitive information in its databases is an important asset. To ensure 
  effective use of these databases in the future, SSA is converting them from 
  legacy systems to more commercially used applications. This will take several 
  years to complete. Additionally, in recent years, the need to recover from a 
  disaster or significant event has become increasingly evident. To better enable 
  itself to recover from such an event, SSA is building a second Data Center to 
  handle some of the current workload of SSA's primary data center and temporarily 
  replace the primary data center in the event of a significant incident. SSA 
  plans to begin occupancy of this facility in January 2009, but there have been 
  delays to the original occupancy date. Because of the importance of the new 
  data center, we plan to continue to monitor SSA's progress. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2009, we plan to complete nine reviews and begin four reviews in the Systems 
  Security and Critical Infrastructure Protection challenge. <br>
  <br>
  WE PLAN TO COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING REVIEWS IN FY 2009 <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IN LEXISNEXIS TOTAL RESEARCH SYSTEM 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA's policies and procedures safeguard PII available in 
  LexisNexis from improper use. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  LexisNexis uses public records and non-public information to provide invaluable 
  fraud detection and identity authentication solutions that help to safeguard 
  citizens and reduce consumers' financial losses. Although PII, such as address 
  history, real property records, and criminal information, available through 
  LexisNexis can be obtained by the general public from various other sources, 
  LexisNexis pulls the information together for easy access. However, information 
  that is not readily available or considered public, such as SSNs and drivers' 
  license numbers, is also made available through LexisNexis. <br>
  SSA contracts with LexisNexis to provide access to data by employees performing 
  their official job function. <br>
  <br>
  FISCALYEAR 2009 FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA's overall security program and practices complied with 
  the requirements of FISMA for FY 2009. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  FISMA requires an Agency-wide information security program and separate annual 
  reviews of the security program performed by the Agency and the Office of the 
  Inspector General. Each year, OMB issues questions to be answered concerning 
  agencies' compliance with FISMA. Congress and OMB use these reports to judge 
  how well agencies are protecting their critical infrastructure and sensitive 
  information. <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW-UP: THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S COMPUTER SECURITY PROGRAM <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA has implemented the recommendations from our June 2001 
  audit, Compliance of the Social Security Administration's Computer Security 
  Program with Applicable Laws and Regulations. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The objective of our 2001 audit was to assess SSA's computer security program. 
  We reviewed the requirements of the Computer Security Act (Pub. L. No. 100-235), 
  Government Information Security Reform Act (Pub. L. No. 106-398), Clinger-Cohen 
  Act of 1996 (Pub. L. No. 104-106), OMB Circular A-130, National Institute of 
  Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-18, and applicable provisions 
  of the Code of Federal Regulations and compared these to SSA's program. SSA 
  agreed with the five recommendations in our report, which were as follows. <br>
  <br>
  Centralize its systems security management structure to comply with the Government 
  Information Security Reform Act and other applicable laws to ensure all key 
  security components responsible for Agency-wide security policy and administration 
  report directly to the Chief Information Officer. <br>
  Develop a more inclusive system security plan for the mainframe and distributed 
  computing environments according to National Institute of Standards and Technology 
  Special Publication 800-18. <br>
  Implement global electronic mail and other appropriate methods for broadcasting 
  computer incidents. <br>
  Develop sanctions for users who cause system disruptions or share passwords. 
  <br>
  Develop a computer system security manual consistent with guidance provided 
  by the National Institute of Standards and <br>
  Technology and incorporate it in all existing computer security policies. <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW-UP: THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S ELECTRONIC MAIL SECURITY REVIEW 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA implemented the recommendations from our September 
  2006 audit of the Social Security Administration's Electronic Mail Security 
  Review. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The objective of our 2006 review was to evaluate the adequacy of electronic 
  mail security controls designed to ensure confidentiality, availability, and 
  integrity of sensitive information. As part of the audit, we evaluated SSA's 
  management, operational and technical controls related to electronic mail security 
  for consistency with Federal standards and guidelines and industry best practices. 
  Based on our audit, we made nine recommendations of which the Agency agreed 
  with seven. <br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW-UP: THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAM OPERATIONS 
  MANUAL SYSTEM SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AT DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA has sufficient security requirements in the Program 
  Operations Manual System to ensure security at its DDS sites. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Disability determinations are performed by an agency in each State or other 
  responsible jurisdiction according to Federal regulations. In carrying out its 
  obligation, each responsible State agency determines claimants' disabilities 
  and ensures there is adequate evidence to support its determinations. <br>
  <br>
  We will evaluate our and PricewaterhouseCoopers' reports from 2001 through 2007 
  to determine which security provisions the Agency agreed to implement and whether 
  it has incorporated those security provisions into its policies and procedures. 
  We will also review Federal security requirements issued or amended during that 
  time period, and determine whether SSA should include these in its DDS requirements. 
  <br>
  <br>
  NEW HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE 12 BADGING PROCESS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess the internal controls over the distribution of Agency badges to contractor 
  personnel. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  HSPD-12 requires that all Federal agencies develop a common identification process 
  for agency personnel and contractor employees. SSA compliance with this directive 
  required the issuance of nearly 100,000 compliant identification badges and 
  the installation of appropriate hardware and supporting software systems for 
  all points of physical access to every SSA facility. <br>
  <br>
  Everyone in any Headquarters building must have and display an appropriate SSA 
  access badge. Under HSPD-12, SSA created an electronic Identity Management System 
  to store the required information and interface with other SSA systems. <br>
  <br>
  The Deputy Commissioner for Human Resources and the appropriate Human Resource 
  branches in the Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Operations conduct and 
  oversee background investigations for SSA employees, contractors, vendors, students, 
  volunteers and other individuals requiring frequent access to SSA's facilities 
  or logical systems. <br>
  <br>
  PHYSICAL SECURITY AT THE OFFICE OF DISABILITY ADJUDICATION AND REVIEW'S HEADQUARTERS 
  BUILDING <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether the ODAR building in Falls Church, Virginia, complies with 
  physical security standards. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  ODAR headquarters occupies approximately 15 floors of a 26-story commercial 
  building in Falls Church. The building contains other Federal and private tenants. 
  <br>
  Following the 1994 Oklahoma City bombing, a Department of Justice study created 
  minimum physical security standards for Federal buildings. The President directed 
  Federal agencies to upgrade the physical security of their facilities based 
  on the Department of Justice's recommendations. SSA placed its version of the 
  Department of Justice standards into its Administrative Instructions Manual 
  System. <br>
  <br>
  Several Federal agencies have published physical security guidelines that go 
  beyond the Department of Justice minimum standards. In 2002, the Department 
  of Defense issued a report on DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Standards for Buildings 
  and made it available to the general public. A VA Task Group recently recommended 
  that all VA facilities adopt the Department of Defense standards. The Federal 
  Emergency Management Agency published scientific research to support that buildings 
  not meeting Department of Defense standards are vulnerable to catastrophic consequences 
  if subjected to a terrorist attack. <br>
  <br>
  SECURITY FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S VOICE OVER INTERNET PROTOCOL 
  CONTRACT <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA's VoIP contract with Nortel Government Solutions, Inc., 
  is properly administered and managed according to the contract's terms. This 
  will result in a series of audits on (1) VoIP Security Measures and (2) Contract 
  Compliance. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  VoIP is the routing of voice conversations over the Internet or any other Internet 
  Protocol-based network. VoIP traffic can be deployed on any Internet Protocol 
  network, including those that do not have a connection to the rest of the Internet. 
  SSA recently awarded a $41 million contract to Nortel Government Solutions Inc., 
  to replace its entire telephone system with a system based on VoIP. The contract 
  will run 2 years. In general, telephone service via VoIP costs less than its 
  equivalent service from traditional sources and is similar to providers of alternative 
  Public Switched Telephone Network service. Cost savings can result from using 
  a single network to carry voice and data transmissions. This is especially evident 
  where users have existing excess network capacity that VoIP can use at no additional 
  cost.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S ABILITY TO ADDRESS FUTURE PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess SSA's efforts to address future processing needs and infrastructure 
  issues at the National Computer Center. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Effective and efficient data processing is essential to SSA fulfilling its mission 
  to the American public. Most of this processing has been done in the National 
  Computer Center on SSA's Headquarters campus. However, concerns regarding the 
  National Computer Center's capacity have been raised, and the Agency planned 
  a second data processing center in North Carolina known as the Durham Service 
  Center. Recent assessments show that this may still not be sufficient to handle 
  the Agency's future data processing needs, and other options are being considered. 
  Lockheed Martin has completed a feasibility assessment of the National Computer 
  Center and expressed concern over SSA's data processing capacity and problems 
  with the National Computer Center's infrastructure. Most of the National Computer 
  Center infrastructure problems stem from the fact that the facility is almost 
  30 years old. <br>
  <br>
  SERVICE DELIVERY AND ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT<br>
  <br>
  In SSA's recently released strategic plan, the Agency identified its employees 
  and information technology as key foundational elements, stating that it must 
  invest in developing and supporting its employees and its information technology 
  since they are essential to everything the Agency does. SSA's strategic plan 
  also identified certain actions that must be taken to preserve the public's 
  trust and confidence in the Agency's programs. These actions include the need 
  to move forward aggressively with process, policy, and systems improvement.<br>
  <br>
  This management challenge includes such areas as the Representative Payee Process, 
  Electronic Government and Managing Human Capital. <br>
  <br>
  Representative Payee Process <br>
  Representative payees continue to be a significant challenge for SSA. Most notably, 
  SSA needs to improve: its identification of incapable beneficiaries in need 
  of representative payees; its selection of suitable representative payees; and 
  its subsequent monitoring to ensure beneficiaries' funds are properly managed. 
  Our audits and investigations of representative payees have found significant 
  problems with the management of beneficiaries' funds that, in some cases, had 
  been occurring for several years in spite of SSA's previous identification of 
  these problems. <br>
  <br>
  Some beneficiaries cannot manage or direct the management of their finances 
  because of their youth or mental or physical impairment. For such people, Congress 
  provided for payment to be made through a representative payee who receives 
  and manages the beneficiary's payments. In recognizing the potential for representative 
  payee misuse of benefits, Congress requires that SSA exercise extreme care in 
  determining whether a payee is needed and in the selection and monitoring of 
  representative payees.<br>
  <br>
  SSA reports there are approximately 5.4 million representative payees who manage 
  about $52.7 billion in annual benefit payments for approximately 7.2 million 
  beneficiaries. While representative payees provide a valuable service for beneficiaries, 
  SSA must provide appropriate safeguards to ensure they meet their responsibilities 
  to the beneficiaries they serve. In addition, the Social Security Protection 
  Act of 2004 (Pub. L. No. 108-203) requires that SSA conduct periodic site reviews 
  of certain types of representative payees. As of February 2008, SSA reported 
  that representative payees subject to periodic review included approximately 
  2,880 organizational representative payees serving 50 or more beneficiaries, 
  375 individual representative payees serving 15 or more beneficiaries, and 1,067 
  representative payees who were authorized to collect a fee. During these reviews, 
  SSA assesses the representative payee's performance by examining beneficiaries' 
  and representative payee's records, and by interviewing beneficiaries. Finally, 
  for representative payees who are problematic or if SSA suspects representative 
  payee misuse of benefits, SSA will request an audit or investigation by the 
  Office of the Inspector General. <br>
  <br>
  Congressional staff has requested that we examine a potential concern about 
  SSA not being aware of aged beneficiaries who may be in need of a representative 
  payee. According to statistics from the medical community, approximately 50 
  percent of individuals over age 85 suffer from dementia or Alzheimer's disease. 
  According to SSA, there are about 4.8 million Title II beneficiaries over age 
  85, of which only 210,000 (4.4 percent) have a representative payee. </p>
<p>In a July 2007 study of individual representative payees serving 14 or fewer 
  beneficiaries and non-fee-for-service organizational payees serving fewer than 
  50 beneficiaries, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reported that SSA should 
  take steps to better prevent and detect misuse of beneficiary funds. In addition, 
  NAS concluded that SSA's current methods to detect misuse of benefits are not 
  reliable. As such, NAS recommended that SSA conduct targeted reviews of those 
  representative payees most likely to misuse benefits. NAS estimated this approach 
  would identify about 7,000 cases of misuse and another 7,000 cases of possible 
  misuse. In FY 2009, we plan to complete two such targeted reviews of representative 
  payees who are likely to commit misuse. One of our reviews will determine whether 
  certain characteristics of representative payees as identified by NAS result 
  in an increased risk of misuse. In another review, we will determine whether 
  individual representative payees who act as organizations or operate &quot;group 
  homes&quot; need more monitoring, as recommended by NAS. <br>
  <br>
  The Agency classifies individual payees who serve 15 or more beneficiaries as 
  individual volume representative payees. Some of these payees serve a significant 
  number of individuals. Certain conditions raise questions about an individual 
  serving large populations of beneficiaries. During the fiscal year, we plan 
  to conduct audits of individual volume representative payees. The audits are 
  intended to determine whether the beneficiaries served by such payees receive 
  the support and benefit their payments are intended to deliver. <br>
  <br>
  Electronic Government <br>
  <br>
  Electronic Government has changed the way Government operates and the way citizens 
  relate to Government. Federal agencies rely heavily on information technology 
  to run their daily operations and deliver products and services. SSA is developing 
  a wide range of Electronic Services (eServices) to improve its services to the 
  public because the Agency is facing what is often referred to as a &quot;silver 
  tsunami&quot; of baby boomer claims. Because of the aging of the baby boomers, 
  SSA is facing an avalanche of retirement and disability claims at the same time 
  it must address large backlogs due to years of increasing workloads and limited 
  resources. <br>
  Over the last 9 years, SSA has automated more of its workload and is attempting 
  to have the public conduct more of their business using SSA's eServices. However, 
  SSA must overcome several challenges to meet its Internet service goals including 
  increasing its use, implementing planned enhancements, and addressing critical 
  issues. Additionally, as the Agency implements its planned expansion of eServices, 
  it also needs to develop appropriate authentication measures tailored to each 
  electronic application to identify individuals and maintain the security of 
  SSA's most sensitive information. Although SSA's Internet retirement application 
  is one of the highest rated Internet applications in the Government, only 18.5 
  percent of retirement benefit claims were filed through the Internet in FY 2008 
  as of August 2008. According to Commissioner Astrue, the on-line filing percentage 
  will need to increase to 50 percent within the next 5 years &quot;. . . in order 
  to keep field offices from being totally overwhelmed.&quot; The Agency believes 
  maximizing the use of modern technology and changing the service delivery model 
  will enable SSA to continue to provide critical services to all future beneficiaries. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Managing Human Capital <br>
  <br>
  SSA, like many other Federal agencies, is being challenged to address its human 
  capital shortfalls. As of March 2008, GAO continued to identify strategic human 
  capital management on its list of high-risk Federal programs and operations. 
  GAO initially identified strategic human capital management as high-risk in 
  January 2001.<br>
  <br>
  By the end of 2012, SSA projects its DI rolls will have increased by 35 percent. 
  Further, the Agency projects 53 percent of its employees will be eligible to 
  retire by FY 2017. It is expected this will result in a loss of institutional 
  knowledge that will affect SSA's ability to deliver quality service to the public. 
  The Agency acknowledges that these two issues combined with a growing workload, 
  technological advances, increased diversity, and changes in economic conditions 
  will have a significant impact on the Agency's workforce, the public's expectations 
  and the Agency's ability to meet those expectations. <br>
  <br>
  SSA's service and staffing challenges must be addressed by leadership and succession 
  planning, strong recruitment and retention strategies, competency development 
  and increased training. Further, technology is essential to increasing productivity, 
  streamlining workload processes, and achieving efficiencies to deliver the kind 
  of service that every claimant, beneficiary, and citizen needs and deserves. 
  In FY 2009, we plan to conduct an evaluation to assess SSA's efforts to identify 
  and address competency gaps in mission critical occupations. Also, we plan to 
  conduct a review to assess the Agency's succession planning as it relates to 
  its automated workloads. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2009, we plan to complete 16 reviews and begin 13 in the Service Delivery 
  and Electronic Government challenge. <br>
  <br>

  AGED BENEFICIARIES IN NEED OF A REPRESENTATIVE PAYEE <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To identify any potential vulnerabilities of direct payment to aged beneficiaries 
  and to determine whether additional safeguards are needed to ensure these beneficiaries' 
  funds are properly managed. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA provides benefits to the most vulnerable members of society-the young, the 
  elderly, and the disabled. Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint representative 
  payees for those beneficiaries judged incapable of managing or directing the 
  management of their benefits. <br>
  <br>
  Congressional staff requested that we examine a potential concern about SSA 
  not being aware of aged beneficiaries who may be in need of a representative 
  payee. According to statistics from the medical community, approximately 50 
  percent of individuals over age 85 suffer from dementia or Alzheimer's disease. 
  According to SSA, there are approximately 4.8 million beneficiaries over age 
  85, of which only 210,000 (4.4 percent) have a representative payee. <br>
  <br>
  CHARACTERISTICS OF REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES THAT MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF BENEFIT 
  MISUSE <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether certain characteristics of representative payees result 
  in an increased risk of benefit misuse. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  In July 2007, NAS issued a report on Improving the Social Security Representative 
  Payee Program: Serving Beneficiaries and Minimizing Misuse. One of the objectives 
  of the NAS review was to identify the types of representative payees who have 
  the highest risk of benefit misuse. In its report, NAS identified several characteristics 
  of individual representative payees that may be potential indicators of misuse 
  or poor performance. To determine whether these characteristics increase the 
  risk of misuse, we identified all individual representative payees who serve 
  14 or fewer beneficiaries. From this group, we identified a population of 3,329 
  representative payees who had at least 3 of the characteristics NAS identified. 
  <br>
  <br>
  FIELD OFFICE PROCEDURES FOR CHARGING AND COLLECTING FEES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA's FOs are complying with policies and procedures for 
  charging and collecting fees for services rendered in response to numberholder 
  and third-party information requests. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA FOs are authorized to charge a fee for services provided in response to 
  individual and third-party information requests that exceed what is provided 
  for free in the normal course of business. Under the Privacy (Pub. L. No. 95-579) 
  and the Freedom of Information Acts (Pub. L. No. 104-231), individuals and third 
  parties have the right to obtain certain information from SSA. SSA is authorized 
  to charge a fee for the cost of providing those services. <br>
  <br>
  FUGITIVE REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess SSA's controls to prevent fugitives from serving as representative 
  payees. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Our March 2003 report, Screening Representative Payees for Fugitive Warrants, 
  concluded that SSA should use fugitive warrant information to screen representative 
  payees because a fugitive felon may not be in the best position to manage a 
  beneficiary's funds. Based on our analysis, we estimated that approximately 
  3,145 fugitives served as payees and managed approximately $81.2 million in 
  Social Security funds. Furthermore, we estimated that if not replaced, current 
  fugitives would manage approximately $19.6 million in Social Security benefits 
  over the next year. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Protection Act of 2004 was signed into law on March 2, 2004. 
  This law, which took effect in April 2005, contained a provision that disqualifies 
  fugitive felons from serving as representative payees. <br>
  <br>
  INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION IN STERLING 
  HEIGHTS, MICHIGAN, AND HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT (2 REVIEWS) <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To ensure the selected representative payee/ guardian is providing beneficiaries 
  the full support and benefit their payments are intended to deliver. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA provides benefits to the most vulnerable members of society-the young, the 
  elderly, and the disabled. Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint representative 
  payees for those beneficiaries judged incapable of managing or directing the 
  management of their benefits. Representative payees (organizations and individuals) 
  receive and manage payments on behalf of these beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  An individual volume representative payee in Sterling Heights, Michigan, serves 
  as the representative payee for approximately 160 individuals and as the legal 
  guardian for some of these individuals.<br>
  <br>
  An individual volume representative payee in Hartford, Connecticut, serves as 
  the representative payee for approximately 244 individuals and the guardian 
  for approximately 178 of these individuals.<br>
  <br>
  INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES SERVING MULTIPLE BENEFICIARIES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether selected individual payees (1) operated as organizations 
  or group homes (2) met the needs of the beneficiaries being served and/or (3) 
  misused Social Security benefits. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  In July 2007, NAS issued a report on Improving the Social Security Representative 
  Payee Program: Serving Beneficiaries and Minimizing Misuse. NAS restricted its 
  national survey to individual payees serving fewer than 15 beneficiaries and 
  non-fee-forservice organizational payees serving fewer than 50 beneficiaries. 
  <br>
  The NAS study concluded SSA's current designation of &quot;individual payee&quot; 
  is too broad. NAS reported the designation mixes payees who serve a single or 
  even a few beneficiaries with payees who operate group homes for up to 14 beneficiaries. 
  Further, the NAS report indicated individual payees who are owners or administrators 
  of group homes have an inherent conflict of interest. NAS concluded that payees 
  of this type require special monitoring. <br>
  We identified all individual representative payees who serve 14 or fewer beneficiaries. 
  From this, we identified a population of 910 representative payees who have 
  the following characteristics. <br>
  <br>
  Serves between 4 and 14 beneficiaries. <br>
  At least three beneficiaries are not family members. <br>
  Manages over $800 in monthly benefits. <br>
  <br>
  MISSION-CRITICAL OCCUPATIONS' CORE COMPETENCIES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess SSA's efforts to identify and address competency gaps in its mission-critical 
  occupations. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA, like many other Federal agencies, is being challenged to address its human 
  capital shortfalls. By the end of 2012, SSA projects its DI rolls will have 
  increased by 35 percent. Further, the Agency projects 53 percent of its employees 
  will be eligible to retire by FY 2017. The &quot;retirement wave&quot; will 
  result in a loss of valuable skills, institutional knowledge, and technical 
  expertise. This may have a profound impact on the public's expectations and 
  SSA's ability to meet those expectations. <br>
  It is imperative that staff in mission-critical occupations possess the competencies 
  to complete their work more efficiently and effectively. In 2001, GAO identified 
  those job series it considered mission-critical for all major Federal agencies. 
  Both GAO and Congress emphasized the importance of hiring, retaining, and developing 
  employees according to competencies. <br>
  | <br>
  There are three key areas related to mission-critical occupations: (1) staffing 
  levels, (2) the development of core competencies, and (3) the closure of competency 
  gaps. However, because of SSA's budget constraints and other limitations, this 
  review will focus on the Agency's development of competencies, gap analysis 
  and improvement plans for closing gaps in mission-critical occupations. <br>
  <br>
  ORGANIZATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 
  IN DALLAS, TEXAS; CLEVELAND, OHIO; AND SALINA, KANSAS (3 REVIEWS) <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether the representative payee (1) has effective safeguards over 
  the receipt and disbursement of Social Security benefits and (2) ensures Social 
  Security benefits are used and accounted for in accordance with SSA's policies 
  and procedures. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Some individuals cannot manage or direct the management of their finances because 
  of their youth or mental and/or physical impairments. Congress granted SSA the 
  authority to appoint representative payees to receive and manage these beneficiaries' 
  payments. A representative payee may be an individual or an organization. SSA 
  selects representative payees for OASDI beneficiaries or SSI recipients when 
  representative payments would serve the individuals' interests. Representative 
  payees are responsible for managing benefits in the best interest of the beneficiary. 
  <br>
  <br>
  QUICK RESPONSE EVALUATION: FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SERVING AS REPRESENTATIVE 
  PAYEES <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To analyze information recorded in SSA's information systems regarding financial 
  institutions serving as representative payees <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The decision to make OASDI and/or SSI payments through a representative payee 
  is serious. It deprives a beneficiary or recipient of direct control over personal 
  finances, and may affect the beneficiary's manner of living. In recognizing 
  the potential for a representative payee to mishandle benefits, Congress requires 
  that SSA exercise extreme care in determining that a representative payee is 
  needed, in selecting a representative payee, and in monitoring the representative 
  payee's performance. <br>
  <br>
  QUICK RESPONSE EVALUATION: THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S ACCESS TO STATE 
  ONLINE VITAL RECORDS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess SSA's progress in expanding its on-line access to States' vital records. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  On-line access to State's vital records improves the speed at which SSA can 
  obtain information necessary for it to process certain actions. Currently, SSA 
  has on-line access to a limited number of States' vital records. However, SSA 
  has been working with representatives from the National Association of Public 
  Health Statistics and Information Systems to obtain on-line access to additional 
  States' vital records. <br>
  <br>
  STATE OF FLORIDA'S USE OF TITLE IV-E FUNDS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether Florida's Department of Human Services is properly offsetting 
  a recipient's Title XVI funds when the State's Foster Care Program receives 
  Title IV-E funds to reimburse a portion of program costs. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  According to SSA policy, Title IV-E funds provided to States' foster care programs 
  are considered income for children who also receive Title XVI benefits. The 
  policy further states that Title XVI payments must be reduced dollar-for-dollar 
  by income derived from Title IV-E benefits. <br>
  <br>
  In April 2006, the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for 
  Children and Families, granted Florida's Department of Human Services a 5-year 
  waiver under Title IV-E of the Act. Effective October 2006, the waiver allows 
  Federal foster care funds to be used for any child-welfare purpose, instead 
  of being restricted to out-of-home care, as generally required under Federal 
  law. Under the waiver, funds can be used for a variety of child welfare services 
  including abuse prevention, in-home services, and family reunification. The 
  increased flexibility in funding is expected to result in improved services 
  for Florida families. <br>
  In recent years, Florida Department of Children and Families has received about 
  $10 million a year in Title XVI funds as reimbursement for the cost of foster 
  care. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION INFORMING BENEFICIARIES OF NEW ELECTRONIC 
  BANKING OPTIONS <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To determine whether SSA is informing beneficiaries of new electronic banking 
  options that include the Direct Express Card and Electronic Transfer Account. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  The Direct Express Card is a debit card sponsored by the Department of the Treasury 
  available to Social Security and SSI recipients. The Direct Express Card allows 
  individuals who do not have a bank account to access their funds with a debit 
  card. The debit card can be used to make purchases from participating merchants, 
  get money from a point-of-sale transaction, and get cash at Automated Teller 
  Machines and financial institutions nationwide. <br>
  <br>
  On December 27, 2006, the Department of the Treasury mailed a letter and brochure 
  to 20,000 Social Security and SSI paper check recipients residing in the Chicago 
  area and rural areas of Southern Illinois to test whether paper check recipients 
  would be interested in signing up to receive their monthly payment via a debit 
  card account.<br>
  <br>
  On January 4, 2008, the Department of the Treasury announced the selection of 
  Comercia Bank to replace JPMorgan Chase as the operating bank for the Direct 
  Express Card program. As of June 10, 2008, SSA and SSI recipients who received 
  paper checks and resided in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, 
  Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas were mailed 
  inserts with their benefit checks introducing the Direct Express Card. Treasury 
  expects Direct Express to be offered nationwide through enrollment phases. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S SUCCESSION PLANNING RELATED TO AUTOMATEDWORKLOADS 
  <br>
  <br>
  Objective <br>
  To assess SSA succession planning as it relates to automated workloads. Specifically, 
  we will review the Agency's activities related to the recruitment, training, 
  retention and development of staff who occupy the mission-critical position 
  of information specialist. <br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA is challenged to address increasing workloads as the &quot;baby boom&quot; 
  generation approaches its peak disability and retirement years, at the same 
  time SSA's workforce is retiring. By the end of 2012, SSA estimates its DI and 
  Old-Age and Survivors Insurance benefit rolls will increase by 35 and 18 percent, 
  respectively. Further, SSA projects that by FY 2017 about 53 percent of its 
  employees will be eligible to retire. This &quot;retirement wave&quot; will 
  result in a loss of valuable skills, institutional knowledge and technical expertise 
  that will affect its ability to deliver quality service to the public. <br>
  <br>
  To minimize the impact of this loss of human capital and address expected DI 
  and Old-Age and Survivors Insurance workload increases, SSA plans to increase 
  its use of automation to continuously provide superior services to the American 
  public. Automation is currently the foundation for all SSA's business processes. 
  For example, to manage its mission-critical programs, SSA has automated the 
  Modernized Claims System and the Modernized Supplemental Security Income Claims 
  System. Without automated tools and processes, SSA would not be able to keep 
  up with its workloads or provide the services the American public expects. This, 
  in turn, has challenged SSA's information systems staff to develop new technologies 
  to serve the public. <br>
  <br>
  To ensure it hires, retains, and develops employees needed to provide services 
  to its beneficiaries and recipients, SSA identified those positions it considers 
  critical to obtaining its mission. Of the 14 mission-critical positions identified, 
  SSA considers the information technology specialist position essential to its 
  workload automation efforts. The information technology specialist develops 
  and supports the systems and services used in the Agency's program and business 
  functions. SSA's succession planning should include actions/activities to ensure 
  the Agency has adequate information specialists to develop and maintain automated 
  systems and tools that enhance SSA's ability to provide quality services within 
  an environment of diminishing resources and expanding expectations. </p>
