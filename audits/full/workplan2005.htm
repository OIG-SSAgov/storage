  Annual Work Plan<br>
  Our Annual Work Plan (Plan) outlines our perspective of the top management challenges 
  facing the Social Security Administration (SSA) and serves as a tool for communicating 
  our priorities to SSA, the Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), 
  and other interested parties. The activities described address the fundamental 
  goals related to SSA's mission to administer the Social Security programs and 
  operations effectively and efficiently. Our work is prioritized to focus our 
  resources on those areas that are most vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse. 
  To ensure we provide a coordinated effort, we work closely with the Offices 
  of Investigations, Chief Counsel to the Inspector General, and Executive Operations. 
  <br>
  Our Plan is categorized to mirror the top management challenges that cut across 
  the Government, as outlined in the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and rated 
  by OMB's Scorecard.<br>
  <br>
  The PMA was designed to coordinate agency efforts to &quot;address the most 
  apparent deficiencies and focus resources where the opportunity to improve performance 
  is the greatest.&quot; The PMA's goal is to establish a more responsible and 
  responsive Government that is citizen-centered, results-oriented, and market-based. 
  OMB provides each Federal agency a scorecard rating their performance. The scorecard 
  is designed around a simple grading system: green for success, yellow for mixed 
  results, and red for unsatisfactory. Below is the status of SSA's efforts, as 
  reported by OMB's June 2004 Scorecard.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>This Plan describes 106 reviews we intend to complete, 45 reviews we intend 
  to begin, and 16 performance indicator reviews we will oversee in FY 2005 in 
  the following issue areas. <br>
  <br>
  Social Security Number Protection <br>
  Management of the Disability Process <br>
  Improper Payments<br>
  Internal Control Environment and Performance Measures<br>
  Critical Infrastructure Protection and Systems Security<br>
  Service Delivery<br>
  <br>
  To assist us in this analysis, we crosswalked the PMA, Commissioner Priorities, 
  Social Security Advisory Board, and Government Accountability Office (GAO) high-risk 
  areas to those identified by our prior and ongoing work. The following table 
  demonstrates that our perspective is congruent with other key decisionmakers. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In preparing this Plan, we solicited suggestions from the Agency. We received 
  a number of suggestions for inclusion in our Plan, and we have incorporated 
  as many of them as possible. <br>
  <br>
  We recognize this Plan is dynamic, so we encourage continuous feedback and additional 
  suggestions. This flexibility enables us to meet emerging and critical issues 
  evolving throughout the upcoming year.<br>
  <br>

<p>Social Security Number Protection <br>
  In FY 2003, SSA issued over 17.6 million original and replacement SSN cards, 
  and SSA received approximately $533 billion in employment taxes related to earnings 
  under assigned SSNs. Protecting the Social Security number (SSN) and properly 
  posting the wages reported under SSNs are critical to ensuring eligible individuals 
  receive the full benefits due them.<br>
  <br>
  Efforts to Protect the SSN<br>
  The SSN has become a key to social, legal, and financial assimilation in this 
  country. Because the SSN is so heavily relied on as an identifier, it is also 
  valuable as an illegal commodity. Criminals improperly obtain SSNs by <br>
  (1) presenting false documentation; <br>
  (2) stealing another person's SSN; <br>
  (3) purchasing an SSN on the black market;<br>
  (4) using the SSN of a deceased individual; or <br>
  (5) creating a nine-digit number out of thin air. <br>
  <br>
  To ensure SSN integrity, SSA must employ effective front-end controls in its 
  enumeration process. To effectively combat SSN misuse, we believe SSA should 
  establish a reasonable threshold for the number of replacement SSN cards an 
  individual may obtain during a year and over a lifetime, continue to address 
  identified weaknesses in its information security environment to better safeguard 
  SSNs, and consider revising its policies to require that field offices obtain 
  independent verification of the birth records for U.S. citizens under age 1 
  before SSN assignment.<br>
  <br>
  SSA has taken steps to improve controls within its enumeration process, including 
  establishing the Enumeration Response Team. As a result of the Team's efforts, 
  SSA now performs full collateral verification of all immigration documents before 
  assigning SSNs to noncitizens. SSA requires mandatory interviews for all applicants 
  for original SSNs who are over age 12 (lowered from age 18) and requires evidence 
  of identity for all children, regardless of age. In addition, SSA has established 
  an Enumeration Center in Brooklyn, New York, that focuses exclusively on assigning 
  SSNs and issuing SSN cards. SSA has also created an Identity Theft Workgroup 
  in which we participate.<br>
  <br>
  The SSN and Reported Earnings<br>
  Properly posting earnings ensures eligible individuals receive the full retirement, 
  survivor and/or disability benefits due them. If earnings information is reported 
  incorrectly or not reported at all, SSA cannot ensure all eligible individuals 
  are receiving the correct payment amounts. In addition, SSA's disability programs 
  depend on earnings information to determine whether an individual is eligible 
  for benefits and to calculate the amount of benefit payments.<br>
  <br>
  SSA spends scarce resources correcting earnings data when incorrect information 
  is reported. The Earnings Suspense File (ESF) is the Agency's record of annual 
  wage reports for which wage earners' names and SSNs fail to match SSA's records. 
  As of October 2003, SSA had posted 9.6 million wage items to its </p>
<p>ESF for Tax Year 2001, representing about $56 billion in wages. This was before 
  some planned edits, which may have further reduced this number.<br>
  <br>
  While SSA has limited control over the factors that cause the volume of erroneous 
  wage reports submitted each year, there are still areas where the Agency can 
  improve its processes. SSA can improve wage reporting by educating employers 
  on reporting criteria, identifying and resolving employer reporting problems, 
  and encouraging greater use of the Agency's SSN verification programs. SSA also 
  needs to coordinate with other Federal agencies with separate, yet related, 
  mandates. For example, the Agency now collaborates with the Internal Revenue 
  Service to achieve more accurate wage reporting. <br>
  <br>
  SSA has taken steps to reduce the size and growth of the ESF. For example, SSA 
  has expanded its Employee Verification Service by piloting an on-line service 
  called the Social Security Number Verification Service, which allows employers 
  to verify the names and SSNs of employees before reporting their wages to SSA. 
  The Agency has also modified its automated processes to better identify the 
  numberholder related to suspended items. Whereas previous internal edits used 
  only the name and SSN related to the suspended wage, SSA stated the new processes 
  would use information stored on the earnings and benefits records. <br>
  <br>
  The SSN and Unauthorized Work<br>
  SSA also assigns nonwork SSNs to noncitizens who are (1) in the United States 
  but are not authorized to work and (2) are not present in the United States, 
  but are entitled to a federally-financed benefit that requires an SSN. In recent 
  years, SSA has strictly limited the assignment of such numbers. Furthermore, 
  SSA monitors noncitizens who show earnings under a nonwork SSN and reports this 
  information to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Nonetheless, our audits 
  have noted a number of issues related to nonwork SSNs, including (1) the type 
  of evidence provided to obtain a nonwork SSN, (2) the reliability of nonwork 
  SSN information in SSA's records, (3) the significant volume of wages reported 
  under nonwork SSNs, and (4) the payment of benefits to noncitizens who qualified 
  for their benefits while working in the country without proper authorization. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Recent legislation (Pub. L. 108-203, Social Security Protection Act of 2004) 
  prohibits the payment of Title II benefits based on the earnings of any individual 
  who is not a U.S. citizen or national and who has never been issued an SSN to 
  work in the United States. SSA's implementation of this new law will require 
  increased coordination with DHS to ensure SSA has the correct work status information 
  in its systems.<br>
  <br>
  In FY 2005, we plan to complete 26 reviews in this area and begin 6 reviews.</p>

  <br>
  ANALYSIS OF UNDELIVERABLE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER CARDS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine why SSN cards are returned to the Agency as undeliverable and to 
  evaluate the physical security over these cards.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA estimates between 250,000 and 500,000 SSN cards are returned each year. 
  Undeliverable cards are kept in a secure container in the mailroom and periodically 
  destroyed by contractors. SSA does not have a system in place to track the number 
  of cards that are returned to the Agency as undeliverable. Because returned 
  cards are not counted or logged, there is no way of determining whether there 
  is a pattern that would indicate potential fraudulent activity. </p>
<p> ASSESSMENT OF THE ENUMERATION-AT-ENTRY PROCESS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the effectiveness of SSA's Enumeration-at-Entry process.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA entered into agreements with the Department of State (State) and DHS, formerly 
  the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in 1996 and 2000, respectively, 
  to assist SSA in enumerating certain classes of immigrants. State and DHS collect 
  and transmit to SSA enumeration data collected as part of the immigration process. 
  SSA calls this process Enumeration-at-Entry.<br>
  SSA allows immigrants who are lawfully admitted as permanent residents and age 
  18 or older to apply for an SSN card through Enumeration-at-Entry. By electing 
  to participate in this program, the immigrant does not complete a Form SS-5, 
  Application for a Social Security Card. Instead, the immigrant applies for an 
  original SSN card on the State DS-230 Form, Application for Immigrant Visa and 
  Alien Registration, and DHS electronically transmits to SSA the data elements 
  collected for enumeration purposes. Using these data, SSA assigns an SSN to 
  the immigrant and mails the SSN card to the address the immigrant provided State 
  or DHS.<br>
  <br>
  Enumeration-at-Entry is designed to improve the integrity of the enumeration 
  process because actions are based on certification by State and DHS regarding 
  identity and work authorization. Phase 1, which began in October 2002 consists 
  of State collecting enumeration information from noncitizens over age 18 who 
  are issued visas to become permanent resident aliens in the United States. After 
  Phase 1 is fully implemented, SSA, DHS and State will discuss expanding this 
  process to other groups of immigrants.<br>
  <br>
  CONGRESSIONAL RESPONSE REPORT: EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS' ISSUANCE OF WORK AUTHORIZATION 
  DOCUMENTS TO FOREIGN STUDENTS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether foreign students receiving work authorization letters from 
  schools and assigned SSNs actually enroll, attend classes, and are employed 
  on campus. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Over 500,000 foreign students were enrolled at educational institutions in the 
  United States during the 2002-2003 academic year. Students coming to the United 
  States to pursue full-time academic or vocational studies are admitted under 
  three nonimmigrant classifications: (1) the F-1, which includes academic students 
  in colleges, universities, seminaries, conservatories, academic high schools, 
  other academic institutions and language training; (2) the M-1, which relates 
  only to vocational students; and (3) the J-1, which covers exchange visitors. 
  These 3 categories accounted for approximately 1 million of the 32.8 million 
  nonimmigrants admitted to the United States in 2001. <br>
  <br>
  A recent regulation, Evidence Requirements for Assignment of SSNs; Assignment 
  of SSNs to Foreign Academic Students in F-1 Status, requires that F-1 students 
  without a DHS employment authorization document provide evidence of both work 
  authorization and employment before the Agency will assign them an SSN. Specifically, 
  the F-1 student will need to provide documentation from the school that he/she 
  will be engaging in authorized employment (in the form of written confirmation 
  from a designated school official) and written documentation that he/she is 
  engaged in or has secured employment (in the form of a written statement from 
  the student's employer). <br>
  <br>
  Despite these controls, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs is concerned 
  that some educational institutions are providing students with work authorization 
  letters even though these institutions have no intent to hire the students for 
  on-campus employment. Rather, the schools may be providing these letters solely 
  to assist the students in obtaining SSNs. Additionally, the Committee has asked 
  that we examine certain schools deemed to be &quot;diploma mills,&quot; which 
  are perceived to be in business mainly to assist noncitizens in gaining entrance 
  to the United States via student visas. <br>
  <br>
  INCORRECT DEATH INFORMATION FOR AUXILIARY BENEFICIARIES TURNING 18 YEARS OF 
  AGE<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify individuals who turned 18 years of age and were incorrectly identified 
  by SSA as deceased because they were auxiliary beneficiaries.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Our January 2002 review, Disclosure of Personal Beneficiary Information to the 
  Public (A 01 01-01018), and our August 2002 review, Effectiveness of the Social 
  Security Administration's Earnings After Death Process (A-03-01-11035), identified 
  beneficiaries who were improperly listed as deceased on SSA's Death Master File. 
  At some point these individuals had been Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance 
  (OASDI) auxiliary beneficiaries and, upon turning age 18, were no longer eligible 
  for benefits. In such cases, SSA places a payment status code of &quot;T4&quot; 
  (a child terminated because of attainment of age 18) on their Master Beneficiary 
  Records (MBR). However, those &quot;T4&quot; codes were mistakenly associated 
  with dates of death on the MBR for the same month the &quot;T4&quot; code was 
  entered on the MBR. This information was later propagated to the Death Master 
  File, resulting in these beneficiaries being erroneously listed as deceased. 
  Because SSA releases the Death Master File to the public, the personal information 
  for these individuals is being made available over the Internet. Further, SSA 
  is posting the wages for these individuals to the ESF instead of the MEF, so 
  they are not earning credit towards later benefits. Finally, if they are receiving 
  benefits, SSA will periodically alert the cases, suspend their benefits, and 
  request that they prove they are alive.<br>
  <br>
  MILITARY WAGE ITEMS IN THE EARNINGS SUSPENSE FILE<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether individuals who have public responsibilities and positions 
  of trust, primarily active duty military employees, have wages posted to SSA's 
  ESF and what actions have been taken to resolve these wage problems.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Our September 2003 Profile of the Social Security Administration's Non-Work 
  Alien File (A 14 03-23071) found that individuals who had public responsibilities 
  and positions of trust, including active duty military employees, had wages 
  recorded in SSA's non-work alien file. Our review will determine whether an 
  additional condition exists among military employees where SSA could not match 
  the name and/or SSN on the wage report to Agency records and had to place the 
  wages in the ESF.<br>
  We will review suspended wages in the ESF for Tax Years 1997 to 2002 to (1) 
  determine the number of items submitted to the ESF by military branches and 
  (2) identify potential patterns of errors and irregularities in wage reporting, 
  or other reasons for the suspension of these wage items. </p>
<p> REPORTED EARNINGS BEFORE THE ISSUANCE OF A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA's Master Earnings File is recording earnings for individuals 
  before they are issued an SSN.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA provides OASDI benefits to individuals based on their lifetime earnings 
  reported under a valid SSN. These earnings determine whether an individual has 
  enough quarters of coverage, or work credits, for insured status. Social Security 
  work credits are based on an individual's total annual wages or self-employment 
  income. An individual can earn up to four credits each year. The amount needed 
  for a credit changes from year to year. In 2002, for example, an individual 
  earned one credit for each $870 of wages or self-employment income. When an 
  individual earns $3,480, he or she has earned four credits for the year. <br>
  <br>
  Our March 2003 Congressional Response Report: Social Security Administration 
  Benefits Related to Unauthorized Work (A-03-03-23053), noted that Social Security 
  laws and regulations do not always differentiate between citizens and noncitizens 
  for determining quarters of coverage. As a result, SSA often creates a work 
  history for individuals with valid SSNs, even when some of the earnings belonged 
  to noncitizens who were in the United States illegally or were otherwise unauthorized 
  to work at the time of their earnings but who later obtained a valid SSN.<br>
  <br>
  Earnings posted before enumeration could represent a situation where individuals 
  were working in the economy illegally before enumeration or it could represent 
  other problems, such as improper postings by SSA's edit programs or errors in 
  the Numident fields. Our review of a sample of such cases should help to determine 
  the frequency of such occurrences, their causes, and their potential impact 
  on the integrity of SSA's programs.<br>
  <br>
  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER CARDS ISSUED AFTER DEATH<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA's controls over the issuance of replacement SSN cards where a 
  date of death is present on the Numident.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Individuals applying for a replacement SSN card must complete, sign, and submit 
  an Application for a Social Security Card (Form SS-5) at an SSA field office 
  or through the mail. Because SSA must be certain the individual is who he or 
  she claims to be, SSA requires that each applicant present documentary evidence 
  of his or her identity. An identity document submitted as evidence must be recently 
  issued and provide information so field office personnel can compare its contents 
  with SS-5 data and/or the applicant's physical appearance. <br>
  <br>
  Field office personnel review the SS-5 and determine the validity of supporting 
  evidentiary documents. They then certify and enter applicant information into 
  SSA's Modernized Enumeration System. Once certified, the SSN application undergoes 
  numerous automated edits to further validate applicant information. If the application 
  passes all of these edits, the Modernized Enumeration System issues a replacement 
  SSN card.<br>
  <br>
  SSA will not issue a replacement card when the numberholder is deceased. Rather, 
  the Agency can provide third-party verification, an SSN verification printout, 
  or instructions on how to obtain a Numident. The requestor must provide proper 
  identification and a death certificate, if the death is not posted on the Numident. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Recent audit work has found numerous instances where it appears multiple SSN 
  replacement cards were issued to individuals after a date of death had been 
  posted to the Numident. This review will determine whether the appropriate policy 
  is being followed and identify instances of potential SSN misuse. <br>
  <br>
  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER MISUSE IN THE AGRICULTURE, SERVICES (TEMPORARY LABOR 
  AND CLEANING), AND FOOD SERVICE (BARS AND RESTAURANTS) INDUSTRIES (3 REPORTS)<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the potential for SSN misuse in the agriculture, services, and food 
  service industries. In addition, we will determine actions SSA has taken on 
  the recommendations contained in our January 2001 reports regarding the agriculture 
  and services (temporary labor and cleaning) industries.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  One of SSA's most important responsibilities is to maintain records of wage 
  amounts employers pay individuals. To facilitate this responsibility, SSA created 
  SSNs to maintain individual earnings records and issued workers cards as a record 
  of their SSN. Because SSA calculates future benefit payments based on the earnings 
  an individual has accumulated over his or her lifetime, accuracy in recording 
  those earnings is critical. SSA's ability to do so, however, greatly depends 
  on employers and employees correctly reporting names and SSNs on Forms W-2 (Wage 
  and Tax Statement). <br>
  <br>
  SSA uses over 20 automated edits to match employees' names and SSNs and properly 
  credit their earnings to the Master Earnings File. SSA places wage items that 
  fail to match name and SSN records into its ESF. As of October 2003, SSA had 
  posted 9.6 million wage items to the ESF for TY 2001, representing about $56 
  billion in wages.<br>
  <br>
  SSN misuse often occurs when an individual provides an employer with an SSN 
  that either has (1) never been assigned or (2) already been assigned to another 
  person. Individuals use SSNs illegally for a variety of reasons, one of which 
  is to obtain employment.<br>
  <br>
  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS ISSUED TO NONCITIZENS WHO SUBSEQUENTLY LEAVE THE COUNTRY 
  OR WHOSE IMMIGRATION STATUS EXPIRES<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether noncitizens legally assigned SSNs, but who leave the country 
  or overstay their visas, are misusing the SSNs. Additionally, we will determine 
  what remedies the Agency could implement to prevent such misuse.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Based on work performed by our Office of Investigations, we are aware of situations 
  in which noncitizens legally come to the United States and obtain an SSN based 
  on a temporary work-authorized visa. However, once their visa expires or they 
  leave the country, they or someone else continue to use the SSN to work illegally 
  in the United States, obtain benefits, or defraud financial institutions. <br>
  <br>
  SSA does not have a policy to deactivate or void SSNs. Accordingly, SSNs are 
  assigned to the numberholders for life-regardless of their immigration status.<br>
  <br>
  SUSPENDED AND NONWORK WAGES AMONG THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S PAYROLL 
  AND CONTRACTORS (2 REPORTS)<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA employees, or contractor employees working at SSA, 
  are using nonwork SSNs and/or SSNs that do not match the name/SSN combination 
  in SSA's records.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title II of the Act requires that SSA maintain records of wage amounts employers 
  pay to individuals. Employers report their employees' wages to SSA at the conclusion 
  of each tax year. Wages on those employer reports containing invalid names and/or 
  SSNs cannot be posted to an individual's earnings record in SSA's MEF. Instead, 
  these wages are placed in the ESF-a repository for unmatched wages. Suspended 
  wages can affect a worker's eligibility for and/or the amount of retirement, 
  disability, or survivor benefits. In addition, when wage reports cannot be matched 
  to the correct individual, both SSA and the employer incur additional administrative 
  costs in correcting unmatched wage reports. <br>
  <br>
  Our September 2003 Profile of the Social Security Administration's Non-Work 
  Alien File (A 14 03-23071) found that individuals having public responsibilities 
  and positions of trust, including SSA employees, had wages recorded in SSA's 
  unauthorized employment file. Our review will determine whether SSA also employs 
  individuals and/or contractor employees using nonwork SSNs or names/SSNs that 
  do not match SSA's records.<br>
  <br>
  THE IMPACT OF UNAUTHORIZED EMPLOYMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the accuracy of SSA's Non-Work Alien file and estimate benefit amounts 
  resulting from unauthorized employment.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Each year, SSA informs DHS of noncitizens who are working illegally. SSA sends 
  DHS an electronic data file of information on individuals who have earnings 
  recorded under SSNs assigned for nonwork purposes. Resource priorities and data 
  compatibility problems have prevented the Bureau from making effective use of 
  the unauthorized earnings information it receives.<br>
  <br>
  While SSA notifies DHS of unauthorized employment, the Agency does not routinely 
  tell SSA when it changes a person's employment status from unauthorized to authorized. 
  Unless the person informs SSA directly of such a change, SSA enumeration records 
  will continue to show the person as not authorized for employment and record 
  his or her earnings on the Non-Work Alien file. Consequently, SSA does not know 
  the number of workers shown on the Non-Work Alien file who are authorized for 
  employment and should not be reported to DHS or the amount of SSA benefits resulting 
  from unauthorized employment.<br>
  <br>
  THE SELF-EMPLOYMENT INCOME EARNINGS SUSPENSE FILE<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify patterns of errors and irregularities in the self-employment income 
  posted to the ESF.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title II of the Act requires that SSA maintain accurate records of wages reported 
  by employers. The 1950 Social Security Amendments extended Social Security coverage 
  to most self-employed individuals beginning with Tax Year 1951. Reported earnings 
  and self-employment income (SEI) containing invalid names and/or SSNs cannot 
  be posted to individual earnings records and are instead placed in the ESF and 
  the SEI ESF. Earnings placed in these two suspense files can affect a worker's 
  eligibility for and the amount of retirement, disability, and survivor benefits.<br>
  <br>
  Taxpayers report SEI to the Internal Revenue Service on Schedule SE, which is 
  part of the individual's income tax return. The Internal Revenue Service reports 
  this SEI information to SSA, which maintains microfilm records of the data in 
  a SEI file. The SEI ESF is maintained in the Earnings Reports Branch and the 
  Claims Development branch for investigative purposes.<br>
  Preliminary analysis of the SEI ESF indicates that a high volume of earnings 
  are being reported under &quot;900&quot; series numbers, which appear to be 
  very similar to IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers. <br>
  <br>
  UNIVERSITIES' USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AS STUDENT IDENTIFIERS (REGIONS 
  I THROUGH X)<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess universities' use of SSNs as student identifiers and the potential 
  risks associated with such use.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Millions of students enroll in educational institutions each year. To assist 
  in this process, many colleges and universities use students' SSNs as personal 
  identifiers. The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions 
  Officers found that almost half (1,036) of member institutions that responded 
  to a 2002 survey used SSNs as the primary student identifier.<br>
  The potential for identity theft increases each time an individual divulges 
  his or her SSN. Recent incidents of identity theft at universities have led 
  some schools to reconsider the practice of using SSNs as the primary student 
  identifier. However, at many colleges and universities, students continue to 
  be identified primarily by their SSN, even when another identifier would suffice.<br>
  <br>
  USEFULNESS OF EMPLOYEE CORRESPONDENCE IN REDUCING THE GROWTH OF THE EARNINGS 
  SUSPENSE FILE<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether trends in employer and employee addresses can assist SSA 
  in highlighting problem areas and focusing on employer-assistance activities.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The purpose of the decentralized correspondence process is to contact individuals 
  to resolve SSN and/or name discrepancies on reported earnings. The correspondence 
  provides the wage earner with information about the reported name/SSN and wage 
  amount and requests that the reported information be reviewed, verified or corrected 
  where possible, and returned. While SSA sends most of the decentralized correspondence 
  notices to employees, it sends a notice to the employer when an employee's address 
  is unavailable. In Tax Year 2002, SSA mailed the public over 9 million decentralized 
  correspondence notices.<br>
  <br>
  Returned notices are matched against SSA's internal records and the ESF. If 
  the resubmitted name/SSN information matches SSA's records, the wage item is 
  reinstated from the ESF to the earner's record. If the provided information 
  is still invalid, no further correspondence is sent, and items remain in the 
  ESF awaiting additional edit processes.<br>
  <br>
  A review of the addresses found on these decentralized correspondence notices 
  could better identify those areas of the country where name/SSA mismatches are 
  most prevalent. These data could then be used to assist Employer Services Liaison 
  Officers in targeting their efforts to educate the employer community.<br>
  <br>
  Management of the Disability Process <br>
  <br>
  SSA administers the Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income 
  (SSI) programs, which provide benefits based on disability. Most disability 
  claims are initially processed through a network of Social Security field offices 
  and State Disability Determination Services (DDS). SSA representatives in the 
  field offices are responsible for obtaining applications for disability benefits, 
  disability report forms and authorization for disclosure of information forms 
  as well as verifying non-medical eligibility requirements, which may include 
  age, employment, marital status, or Social Security coverage information. After 
  initial processing, the field office sends the case to a DDS to develop medical 
  evidence and evaluate disability. <br>
  <br>
  Once SSA establishes an individual is eligible for disability benefits under 
  either the DI or SSI program, the Agency turns its efforts toward ensuring the 
  individual continues to receive benefits only as long as SSA's eligibility criteria 
  are met. For example, a continuing disability review (CDR) may show the individual 
  no longer meets SSA's disability criteria or has demonstrated medical improvement.<br>
  <br>
  If an individual disagrees with the Agency's decision on his/her claim or CDR, 
  the claimant can appeal to SSA's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA). OHA's 
  field structure consists of 10 regional offices and 140 hearing offices. OHA's 
  administrative law judges hold hearings and issue decisions. In FY 2003, hearing 
  offices processed 571,928 cases. OHA's average processing time has increased 
  significantly from 274 days in FY 2000 to 344 days in FY 2003. Further, the 
  pending workload was 591,562 cases on September 30, 2003, whereas it was 346,756 
  cases on September 30, 2000. We have focused our attention on weaknesses within 
  OHA-such as the backlog of cases, safeguards for sensitive information in case 
  files, and shredding documents. <br>
  <br>
  GAO added modernizing Federal disability programs-including SSA's-to its 2003 
  high-risk list due, in part, to outmoded concepts of disability, lengthy processing 
  times, and decisional inconsistencies. In September 2003, the Commissioner of 
  Social Security proposed a new approach to improving the disability determination 
  process, which includes several initiatives that emphasize timely and accurate 
  disability decisions. For example, a quick-decision step would initially sort 
  claims based on information provided by claimants to identify people who are 
  obviously disabled. Additionally, the Commissioner proposed an in-line quality 
  review process and a centralized quality control unit. The Commissioner views 
  her September 2003 proposal as the first step in a collaborative process eventually 
  leading to a final plan for disability improvements. <br>
  <br>
  In addition to her long-term proposal, the Commissioner has accelerated the 
  Agency's transition to the electronic disability folder. The electronic disability 
  folder will allow for disability claims information to be stored electronically 
  and transmitted electronically between field offices, DDSs, and OHA. <br>
  <br>
  Disability Fraud<br>
  Fraud is an inherent risk in SSA's disability programs. Some unscrupulous people 
  view SSA's disability benefits as money waiting to be taken. A key risk factor 
  in the disability program is individuals who feign or exaggerate symptoms to 
  become eligible for disability benefits. Another key risk factor is the monitoring 
  of medical improvements for disabled individuals to ensure those individuals 
  who are no longer disabled are removed from the disability rolls. <br>
  <br>
  We are working with SSA to address the integrity of the disability programs 
  through the Cooperative Disability Investigation (CDI) program. The CDI program's 
  mission is to obtain evidence that can resolve questions of fraud in SSA's disability 
  programs. The CDI program is managed in a cooperative effort between SSA's Office 
  of Operations, the OIG, and the Office of Disability Programs. There are 18 
  CDI units operating in 17 States. In the first half of FY 2004, the CDI units 
  saved SSA almost $64 million by identifying fraud and abuse related to initial 
  and continuing claims within the disability program. <br>
  In FY 2005, we plan to complete 10 reviews and begin 2 reviews in this area.</p>

  The Social Security Administration's Ticket to Work Program-Employment Networks</p>
<p>EVALUATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S ELECTRONIC DISABILITY INITIATIVE<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA's project management of its Electronic Disability Initiative 
  will enable the Agency to meet the project's expected functionality, including 
  systems security, while complying with laws and regulations pertaining to system 
  development efforts.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Electronic Disability Initiative is the Agency's technological approach 
  to automating the disability claims process. The Electronic Disability Initiative 
  is expected to assist the Agency in finding innovative ways to meet the challenge 
  of increasing workloads in the future. The Electronic Disability initiative 
  will replace the current paper claims folder with an electronic record that 
  can be accessed by all case processing components. Electronic Disability is 
  expected to eliminate the need to print, mail, store and reconstruct the paper 
  claims folder; <br>
  prevent keying of the same information at multiple case processing locations; 
  <br>
  control and assign work from electronic queues rather than paper folders; and 
  <br>
  ensure disability files are available when an appeal is filed or continuing 
  disability review is due.<br>
  <br>
  IMPACT OF DUE PROCESS ON SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME AND DISABILITY INSURANCE 
  BENEFIT PAYMENTS MADE DURING THE APPEALS PROCESS (2 REPORTS)<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the financial impact of SSA's appeals process on the SSI and DI 
  benefit payments made under Public Law 97-455.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  A determination of benefit cessation is made when a CDR reveals the beneficiary 
  no longer meets the requirements for disability benefits. Benefit cessation 
  decisions are made by disability examiners in the Office of Central Operations 
  and the DDS as well as disability specialists in the program service centers. 
  Public Law 97-455 gives the disabled beneficiary the option for benefit continuation 
  through the reconsideration and/or administrative law judge hearing process 
  in medical cessation determinations. <br>
  It takes approximately 322 days for initial claims and CDRs to go through the 
  OHA level of appeal. Benefit payments made during the OHA appeal process are 
  considered overpayments if the cessation decision is upheld. SSA waives the 
  overpayment when the claimant is found to be without fault in causing the overpayment, 
  and recovery or adjustment would defeat the purpose of the disability program. 
</p>
<p> OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS MEGASITE BAR-CODING SYSTEM<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether the technological and management improvements implemented 
  at the Megasite effectively track case folders and safeguard folders from loss.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Appeals for disability claims are handled within the Office of Appellate Operations. 
  Folders for denied claims are sent to the Megasite in Springfield, Virginia. 
  The Megasite is the central repository for all claims pending the possibility 
  that the claimant will request a review of the file by an Administrative Appeals 
  Judge. In FY 2003, we reviewed the operations of the OHA Megasite. We conducted 
  the review because the computer inventory system was losing data and SSA staff 
  could not find requested folders. <br>
  <br>
  We tested the Megasite's physical and computerized inventories. The Megasite 
  had approximately 200,000 folders at the time of our audit. We selected a random 
  sample of 300 folders from the inventory system. We projected OHA could not 
  locate as many as 10,100 folders. OHA subsequently installed new computer and 
  bar coding equipment. <br>
  <br>
  We made a number of recommendations regarding Megasite operations including 
  improving the technology in the Megasite; enhancing accountability for records 
  management by collecting information on the number of lost folders and costs 
  to replicate missing documents; and developing formal reports detailing the 
  results of the inventories to include the count of folders inventoried and any 
  discrepancies noted. <br>
  <br>
  SSA claims the new bar-coding system has reduced the time to code and file cases 
  by 83 percent and has reduced the number of aged cases and Appeals Council decisions 
  that are remanded to hearing offices as a result of lost files.</p>
<p> OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS PRE-EFFECTUATION REVIEW PROCESS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the effectiveness of the pre-effectuation review process.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  As part of its continuing efforts to improve the quality of its disability determinations, 
  SSA has modified the review process involving disability allowance decisions 
  made by administrative law judges. In August 1998, the Agency began the pre-effectuation 
  review process of administrative law judge decisions. This process allows the 
  Office of Quality Assurance and Performance Assessment (OQA) to review allowance 
  decisions made by administrative law judges and refer them to the Appeals Council 
  for review. Pre-effectuation reviews focus on cases that involve problematic 
  issues or have a higher likelihood of error. Once referred, the Appeals Council 
  considers the case and OQA's reasons for believing the decision should be reviewed. 
  The Appeals Council has 60 days to look at those cases it decides to review. 
  After its review, the Council can issue its own decision on the case or remand 
  the case to the administrative law judge who initially decided to allow the 
  case. <br>
  SSA initiated the pre-effectuation review process to identify policy issues 
  that should be clarified through publication of regulations or rulings. Discussions 
  with SSA staff indicate the pre-effectuation review process has identified differences 
  in disability determinations between OQA policy and the administrative law judges' 
  decisions. Through the pre-effectuation review process, OQA has identified cases 
  that were initially allowed by the administrative law judges but that OQA feels 
  should be disallowed. Further, after referral from OQA, the Appeals Council 
  often agrees with OQA's position and remands such cases to the administrative 
  law judges for further review.<br>
  <br>
  OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS REVERSAL OF DISABILITY DENIAL DECISIONS INVOLVING 
  INVESTIGATIVE INFORMATION FROM COOPERATIVE DISABILITY INVESTIGATION UNITS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the extent of and the reasons for OHA reversal of DDS denial decisions 
  when the denial was based on evidence obtained from a CDI Unit.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The CDI program is managed in a cooperative effort between SSA's Office of Operations, 
  the OIG, and the Office of Disability Programs. SSA provides virtually all of 
  the funding for the CDI program while OIG maintains the daily operations. Since 
  FY 1998, 18 units have been opened in 17 States. CDI Units support SSA's strategic 
  goal of establishing zero tolerance for fraud, thus ensuring public confidence 
  in the integrity of SSA's programs and operations. The CDI Units report facts 
  uncovered during an investigation to resolve questions of fraud in SSA's disability 
  programs. The CDI Unit does not make disability determinations but provides 
  information to the State DDSs to make timely and accurate disability determinations. 
  <br>
  In FY 2003, CDI Units confirmed 1,640 fraud cases. As a result, SSA avoided 
  improper payments of approximately $102 million.<br>
  <br>
  SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME RECIPIENT WAGES REPORTED TO THE EARNINGS SUSPENSE 
  FILE<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether existing information in SSA's systems, including correspondence 
  with employees, can assist the Agency in detecting suspended wages related to 
  SSI recipients.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title II of the Act requires that SSA maintain records of wage amounts employers 
  pay individuals. Employers report their employees' wages to SSA at the conclusion 
  of each tax year. Wages on those employer reports containing invalid names and/or 
  SSNs cannot be posted to an individual's earnings record in SSA's Master Earnings 
  File. Instead, these wages are placed in the ESF. Suspended wages can affect 
  a worker's eligibility for and/or the amount of retirement, disability, or survivor 
  benefits. In addition, when wage reports cannot be matched to the correct individual, 
  both SSA and the employer incur additional administrative costs correcting unmatched 
  wage reports.<br>
  <br>
  As of July 2002, the ESF contained approximately 244 million wage items totaling 
  about $421 billion related to Tax Years 1937 through 2001. In Tax Year 2001 
  alone, 9.6 million items and $56 billion in wages were posted to the ESF. Removal 
  of wage items and their associated dollar value from the ESF only occurs when 
  the wages can be matched and posted to an individual's Master Earnings File.<br>
  <br>
  SSA sends decentralized correspondence to employees to resolve SSN and/or name 
  discrepancies on reported earnings. The correspondence provides the wage earner 
  with information about the reported name/SSN and wage amount and requests that 
  the reported information be reviewed, verified or corrected where possible, 
  and returned. While SSA sends most of the decentralized correspondence notices 
  to employees, it sends a notice to the employer when an employee's address is 
  unavailable.<br>
  <br>
  Wages posted to the Master Earnings File are used to identify SSI recipients 
  who are working. If an SSI recipient's wages are in the ESF, his or her SSI 
  payments could be too high. Our review will determine whether wages in the ESF 
  could be used to update earnings records and locate potential overpayments to 
  SSI recipients.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIAL DISABILITY WORKLOAD 
  CASES<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA has identified and taken actions to implement system 
  enhancements to prevent future Special Disability Workload cases and identified 
  the universe of Special Disability Workload cases.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA identified individuals who were receiving SSI payments and who appear to 
  be insured for, but were not receiving, disability benefits under the DI program. 
  SSA refers to these cases as the Special Disability Workload. <br>
  <br>
  Each year, SSA identifies individuals who meet insured status for DI benefits. 
  SSA uses a &quot;KZ diary&quot; to alert field office staff to those cases where 
  an individual receiving SSI payments is likely to be insured for disability 
  benefits under the OASDI program. However, SSA's systems did not always identify 
  all SSI applicants who were insured for disability benefits under the DI program 
  or gained insured status through subsequent earnings. <br>
  <br>
  In 1999, SSA identified approximately 130,000 Special Disability Workload cases. 
  In FY 2002, this workload increased to 300,000 cases. In its FY 2003 Performance 
  and Accountability Report, SSA stated the Agency is reviewing approximately 
  476,000 Special Disability Workload cases for potential DI entitlement.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S TICKET TO WORK PROGRAM<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To conduct a performance review of SSA and its contractor, Maximus, Inc., to 
  ensure contract objectives are being met and are in accordance with the Ticket 
  to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Ticket to Work program was established by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives 
  Improvement Act of 1999. The program provides eligible DI and SSI beneficiaries 
  with tickets that can be used to obtain vocational rehabilitation or employment 
  services through an Employment Network or State vocational rehabilitation agency. 
  The program is intended to increase access to, and the quality of, rehabilitation 
  and employment services. The Ticket to Work program was designed to provide 
  beneficiaries greater freedom and choice of service providers, create competition 
  to provide high-quality services that are responsive to beneficiary needs and 
  give providers incentives to deliver services in the most efficient and appropriate 
  manner. Daily administration of the Ticket to Work program is the responsibility 
  of a program manager. SSA has contracted Maximus, Inc., to perform this role. 
  The contract with Maximus includes 23 tasks representing the specific services 
  it is required to provide. <br>
  <br>
  We will review the following 10 tasks identified in the contract. The remaining 
  tasks will be assessed in separate reviews. <br>
  <br>
  Task 1 - Contractor Orientation<br>
  Task 2 - Start-up Plan <br>
  Task 3 - Toll-free Number <br>
  Task 8 - Ticket Program Training <br>
  Task 9 - Management of Ticket Process </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Task 16 - Monthly Progress Reports <br>
  Task 17 - Annual Report <br>
  Task 20 - Periodic Meetings with SSA Project Officer <br>
  Task 21 - Periodic Special Studies <br>
  Task 22 - Conference Planning<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S WORKERS' COMPENSATION DATA MATCH WITH THE 
  STATE OF TEXAS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To report on the status of SSA's pilot project matching DI records with Texas 
  workers' compensation (WC) payment data. As part of this audit, we plan to evaluate 
  the procedures used to complete the matching process, summarize the impact of 
  unreported and incorrectly reported WC payments on DI benefits, and determine 
  the status of collection and payment of over/underpayments identified during 
  the matching process.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA administers the OASDI program under Title II of the Act to provide benefits 
  to retired and disabled workers, including their dependents and survivors. Benefits 
  are reduced or totally offset if a disabled worker is also entitled to State 
  WC payments. <br>
  <br>
  On August 15, 2000, SSA and the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission signed 
  an agreement for the Commission to provide SSA WC records for a matching operation. 
  SSA identified 3,463 cases for which it had no prior WC information (Type A 
  alerts) and 1,773 cases for which it did have WC information but for which the 
  amounts in SSA's records differed from the amounts in the Texas WC file (Type 
  B alerts). <br>
  <br>
  Our April 2003 Management Advisory Report: The Social Security Administration's 
  Workers' Compensation Data Match with the State of Texas reported that we could 
  not evaluate the results of SSA's WC data match with the State of Texas because 
  SSA had not (1) completed its analysis of the DI cases with WC data identified 
  from the match, (2) conducted a match against SSI records, (3) assigned overall 
  accountability of the Texas match project to any particular component, (4) defined 
  when it will derive the results necessary to determine whether the project will 
  be worth expanding to other States, or (5) conducted or started the process 
  of conducting a cost-benefit analysis as of the time of our review. <br>
  <br>
  Based on our recommendation, SSA designated the Office of Disability and Income 
  Security Programs to oversee, consolidate, and report the work being done by 
  the various SSA components involved in the project and establish time frames 
  for the completion of work by each component and the lead office. SSA also stated 
  that OQA would perform the cost-benefit analysis for the Title II portion of 
  the Texas data match. As of May 2004, SSA had completed its review of cases 
  identified from matching records from the Texas database to SSA beneficiary 
  records. <br>
</p>
<p>Improper Payments <br>
  SSA issues benefit payments under the OASDI and SSI programs. Since SSA is responsible 
  for issuing timely benefit payments for complex entitlement programs to about 
  50 million individuals, even the slightest error in the overall process can 
  result in millions of dollars in over- or underpayments.<br>
  <br>
  Improper payments are defined as payments that should not have been made or 
  were made for incorrect amounts. Examples of improper payments include inadvertent 
  errors, payments for unsupported or inadequately supported claims, or payments 
  to ineligible beneficiaries. Furthermore, the risk of improper payments increases 
  in programs with<br>
  a significant volume of transactions, complex criteria for computing payments, 
  and an overemphasis on expediting payments. <br>
  <br>
  The President and Congress have expressed interest in measuring the universe 
  of improper payments within the Government. In August 2001, OMB published the 
  FY 2002 PMA, which included a Government-wide initiative for improving financial 
  performance. In November 2002, the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 
  was enacted, and OMB issued guidance in May 2003 on implementing this law.<br>
  <br>
  Under the Act, agencies that administer programs where the risk of improper 
  payments is significant must estimate their annual amount of improper payments 
  and report this information in their Annual Performance and Accountability Reports. 
  OMB works with each agency to establish goals for reducing improper payments 
  for each program. <br>
  <br>
  SSA and the OIG have had discussions on such issues as detected versus undetected 
  improper payments and avoidable versus unavoidable overpayments that are outside 
  the Agency's control and a cost of doing business. In August 2003, OMB issued 
  specific guidance to SSA to only include avoidable overpayments in its improper 
  payment estimate because these payments could be reduced through changes in 
  administrative actions. Unavoidable overpayments that result from legal or policy 
  requirements are not included in SSA's improper payment estimate.<br>
  <br>
  SSA has been working to improve its ability to prevent over- and underpayments 
  by obtaining beneficiary information from independent sources sooner and/or 
  using technology more effectively. For example, the Agency is continuing its 
  efforts to prevent improper payments after a beneficiary dies through the use 
  of Electronic Death Registration information. Also, the Agency's CDR process 
  identifies and prevents payments to beneficiaries who are no longer disabled. 
</p>
<p>In FY 2004, we focused on improper payments that go undetected by SSA's normal 
  processes. For instance, in one review of disabled beneficiaries who work, we 
  found that SSA had assessed about $1.78 billion in overpayments for about 117,320 
  individuals. However, we estimated the Agency did not detect about $1.37 billion 
  in overpayments to about 63,000 beneficiaries. SSA is implementing eWork, a 
  new initiative to strengthen controls in this area. <br>
  <br>
  Working with SSA, we have made great strides in reducing benefit payments to 
  prisoners and SSI payments to fugitive felons, and these efforts continue. However, 
  our work has shown that improper payments-such as those related to WC-continue 
  to diminish the Social Security trust funds. Additionally, with the passage 
  of the Social Security Protection Act of 2004, SSA faces new challenges in preventing 
  and recovering improper payments-such as OASDI benefits to fugitives. <br>
  In FY 2005, we plan to complete 19 reviews and begin 12 reviews in this area.</p>

  CONTROLS OVER TITLE II REPLACEMENT CHECKS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the adequacy of controls over the number of double-check negotiations 
  issued to the same beneficiary or representative payee and the adequacy of actions 
  to recover double-check negotiations.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  A recent audit of the controls over Title XVI replacement checks found that 
  SSA has neither adequate controls to prevent individuals from negotiating multiple 
  replacement checks nor procedures to promptly recover overpayments. The number 
  of double-check negotiations has continued to increase in recent years, and 
  SSA needs to take further actions to address this problem. Based on our audit 
  results, we recommended additional training, automation enhancements, increased 
  use of administrative sanctions and direct deposit, and assistance to field 
  offices with high numbers of double-check negotiations.<br>
  Our review of the data of Title II double-check negotiations showed there were 
  over 200 cases of beneficiaries with 5 or more double-check negotiations in 
  a 2.5 year time frame.<br>
  <br>
  CONTROLS OVER UNNEGOTIATED CHECKS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the effectiveness of controls over unnegotiated checks.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA initiated the Unnegotiated Check Project to identify Title II beneficiaries 
  who have not cashed 10 or more checks within the last 5 years. SSA attempted 
  to contact beneficiaries by mail and telephone. In some cases, field representatives 
  also went to beneficiaries' addresses. In cases where SSA was ultimately unable 
  to locate beneficiaries, it suspended benefits with the current operating month 
  pending any further clarification of the claimant's status. <br>
  <br>
  At the end of this process, SSA examined each case and concluded checks had 
  not been cashed because the beneficiary had died, was incapacitated, or had 
  moved. In a number of cases, claimants were aware they had not cashed the checks 
  but were unaware the checks became void after a certain number of days. In other 
  cases, SSA could not locate the claimant or fraud was involved in some way. 
  For example, some individuals were deceased, but someone was cashing their checks. 
  In New York, SSA found 368 claimants who had 10 or more unnegotiated checks 
  in the 5-year period ended December 2002. SSA referred these cases to our Office 
  of Investigations.<br>
  <br>
  DISABLED SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME RECIPIENTS WITH EARNINGS ON THE MASTER 
  EARNINGS FILE<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA considered the earnings of disabled individuals when 
  determining SSI eligibility and payment amounts.<br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  SSA considers individuals to be disabled if they cannot engage in any substantial 
  gainful work activity because of a physical or mental impairment. This inability 
  to work must have lasted (or be expected to last) for 12 continuous months or 
  end in death.<br>
  SSI program rules require that SSA consider disabled recipients' earnings when 
  determining eligibility and payment amounts. To identify unreported or underreported 
  earnings, SSA conducts various computer data matches. For example, it compares 
  earnings reported to the Master Earnings File with its SSI payment records.</p>
<p> FOLLOW-UP: THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S CONTROLS TO PREVENT AND DETECT 
  DIRECT DEPOSIT FRAUD<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To follow-up on prior recommendations and determine the effectiveness of SSA's 
  controls over the prevention and detection of direct deposit fraud and irregularities.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  One of SSA's strategic goals is to deliver citizen-centered, high-quality service. 
  One way SSA plans to achieve this goal is by expanding the use of Internet and 
  toll-free telephone services. While expanding the use of electronic services 
  will improve SSA's responsiveness, it will also increase the risk of unauthorized 
  access to SSA records and beneficiary payments. <br>
  SSA offers many services to customers through its 1-800 number telephone service, 
  including change of direct deposit information. SSA is also affiliated with 
  the QuickStart direct deposit program. QuickStart allows beneficiaries to have 
  their benefit payments deposited electronically in their checking or savings 
  account without direct interaction or contact with SSA staff. <br>
  <br>
  We issued an early alert memorandum in 1999 and a management advisory report 
  in 2001. Our early alert stated SSA needed to train all service representative 
  and teleservice representatives on the proper detection and reporting procedures 
  for potential direct deposit fraud incidents and establish an automated trail 
  to track electronic transactions originating outside the Agency.<br>
  Our management advisory report stated People can circumvent controls designed 
  to prevent direct deposit fraud in situations where SSA has no face-to-face 
  contact with the customer or beneficiary.<br>
  <br>
  SSA has insufficient controls in place to prevent or detect fraud, or the assignment 
  of future benefits to third parties, when depository financial institutions 
  initiate direct deposit transactions.<br>
  <br>
  Transactions initiated by depository financial institutions can be used to bypass 
  SSA's representative payee process.<br>
  <br>
  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER PROHIBITING PAYMENTS TO TERRORISTS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA's internal controls over the implementation of Executive Order 
  13224 prohibiting payments to terrorists.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  On September 23, 2001, the President signed Executive Order 13224, Blocking 
  Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, Threaten to Commit, 
  or Support Terrorism. On December 18, 2002, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) 
  issued Treasury Financial Manual, Bulletin No. 2003-04 notifying Federal agencies 
  that they must not make payments to any individual or organization listed on 
  Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control website, which contains a list of 
  persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism. The Bulletin requires 
  that agencies consult the website before making payments.<br>
  <br>
  The 89-page list of organizations and individuals is posted on the Office of 
  Foreign Assets Control website: http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/sanctions/terrorism.html. 
  The individuals and organizations are listed by name and alias, and the individual 
  data vary as far as detail. In some cases, a date of birth or partial date of 
  birth is provided, and, in rare cases, an SSN is listed.<br>
  <br>
  To comply with the Executive Order, SSA needs to ensure that none of the individuals 
  or organizations is receiving benefits or any type of payments from SSA.<br>
  <br>
  INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING BENEFITS UNDER MULTIPLE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS AT THE 
  SAME ADDRESS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify individuals who are inappropriately receiving Social Security benefits 
  and SSI payments under multiple SSNs at the same mailing address.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  When an individual applies for OASDI benefits or SSI payments, SSA staff asks 
  the person about any prior applications for benefits. They do this to ensure 
  individuals who may be entitled on more than one record receive the correct 
  amount, as the total benefits payable should not exceed the largest benefit 
  payable on any one record. In addition, SSA runs a Master File Duplicate Detection 
  Operation semiannually to identify OASDI records that appear to be duplicates 
  based on name, date of birth, and ZIP Code. SSA personnel review the records 
  to determine whether they relate to the same beneficiary, correct the benefit 
  amounts (if necessary), and assess any overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  Although SSA has controls in place to identify and prevent multiple benefit 
  payments to the same person, we were alerted to three cases in January 2004 
  where the beneficiary inappropriately received benefits under multiple SSNs 
  at the same address. To identify the extent of this situation, we analyzed a 
  data extract of approximately 47 million OASDI beneficiaries and 7 million SSI 
  recipients receiving payments in March 2004. Based on our analysis of these 
  SSNs, address information and benefit records, we initially identified 381 beneficiaries 
  who may have received benefits inappropriately under at least 2 different SSNs 
  at the same address.<br>
  <br>
  INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING MULTIPLE AUXILIARY OR SURVIVORS BENEFITS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether individuals who receive multiple auxiliary or survivors 
  benefits are entitled to the benefit payments.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In February 2004, during our audit of Individuals Receiving Multiple Childhood 
  Disability Benefits, we identified a new population of 1,514 individuals who 
  appeared to be receiving multiple auxiliary or survivor benefits inappropriately. 
  The OASDI program provides auxiliary benefits to the eligible spouses and children 
  of retired or disabled workers. In addition, benefits may be payable to the 
  survivors of deceased workers. Individuals may be entitled to auxiliary or survivor 
  benefits based on several workers' earnings (for example, based on the earnings 
  of both parents) but generally may only be paid the higher of the two.<br>
  <br>
  We referred the 1,514 cases to SSA, and we are working with the Agency to ensure 
  corrective action is taken.<br>
  <br>
  INFORMATION SYSTEM CONTROLS OVER WORKERS' COMPENSATION PAYMENTS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the effectiveness of the application controls governing the correct 
  calculation of WC offset amounts in the Title II Disability System. Also, we 
  will determine whether the changes made for the Title II redesign have corrected 
  the rejection of certain WC cases.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Since 2002, disability claims involving WC offset can be processed in SSA field 
  offices. However, the Title II Disability System is rejecting certain WC cases. 
  A systems error or a claims representative improperly processing the case could 
  be causing the rejection of certain cases. Furthermore, rejected cases tend 
  to be more time-consuming and costly to process because both the field offices 
  and the program service centers have to work them. <br>
  <br>
  The Social Security Act requires that SSA offset disability benefits for individuals 
  who receive Federal, State or locally administered WC benefits in most States. 
  However, 14 States are required by State law to offset WC benefits with Title 
  II disability benefits. <br>
  <br>
  When an individual applies for Title II disability benefits, field office personnel 
  determine whether WC may be involved. If SSA approves disability benefits and 
  the applicant's WC claim is pending, SSA requires that beneficiaries report 
  receipt of subsequent WC payments. SSA policies and procedures require that 
  personnel follow up on WC issues until resolved. SSA's Modernized Claims System 
  generates a one-time diary alert after benefit approval. This diary alert reminds 
  personnel to follow up on pending WC issues. Program service center personnel 
  must manually establish additional diaries to continue developing WC issues.<br>
  <br>
  MANUAL CHANGES TO TITLE II BENEFITS VIA THE MANUAL ADJUSTMENT CREDIT AND AWARD 
  DATA ENTRY SYSTEM<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA's procedure for manually changing Title II benefit 
  payments via the Manual Adjustment Credit and Award Data Entry system results 
  in payment errors.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  A Manual Adjustment Credit and Award Process action establishes a new record 
  and/or changes any or all previously established MBR data.<br>
  <br>
  When a beneficiary receives payment on more than one record, the underpayment 
  or overpayment is usually manually calculated; therefore, there is the potential 
  for human error using the Manual Adjustment Credit and Award Process/Manual 
  Adjustment and Award Data Entry system. <br>
  <br>
  We believe the potential for error, based on prior OIG work, warrants reviewing 
  this area. In <br>
  FY 2002, SSA assessed about $1.6 billion in new Title II overpayments-a portion 
  of which was manually calculated. <br>
  <br>
  PAYROLL TAX REPORTING BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S CONTRACTORS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA's contractors are appropriately paying payroll taxes 
  on their employees.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In the February 2004 audit, Some DoD Contractors Abuse the Federal Tax System 
  with Little Consequence, GAO reported that Department of Defense (DoD) and Internal 
  Revenue Service records showed that over 27,000 DoD contractors owed about $3 
  billion in unpaid Federal taxes as of September 30, 2002. Of these contractors, 
  GAO found that over 25,600 contractors owed payroll taxes, with some dating 
  back to the early 1990s. These payroll taxes included amounts withheld from 
  employee wages for Social Security, Medicare, Federal individual income taxes 
  and the employer's related matching contributions for Social Security and Medicare.<br>
  <br>
  As of May 2004, SSA had about 2,600 active contracts totaling over $1.3 billion. 
  These contracts relate to a variety of SSA operations, including medical services, 
  worker rehabilitation, consulting/auditing, and verification services. We will 
  review the earnings records of SSA's contractors to verify that Social Security 
  and Medicare payroll taxes are being collected and reported accurately.<br>
  <br>
  REPRESENTATIVE PAYEE REPORTS INDICATING EXCESS CONSERVED FUNDS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL 
  SECURITY INCOME RECIPIENTS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate SSA's policies and procedures for processing Representative Payee 
  Reports indicating excess conserved funds for SSI recipients. Specifically, 
  we will evaluate SSA's controls to ensure excess conserved funds information 
  is forwarded to the appropriate SSA field office for review and compliance with 
  policies for resolving reported excess conserved funds.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Under the SSI program, to be eligible for benefits, a recipient is limited to 
  $2,000 in resources (or $3,000 for recipients with a spouse who is also eligible 
  for benefits). If the resource limits are exceeded, benefit payments to the 
  recipient are usually suspended. Benefits are resumed if the recipient's resources 
  subsequently fall below the limit. <br>
  <br>
  Representative payees are required to provide SSA an annual Representative Payee 
  Report accounting for how benefits were spent and how much in benefits were 
  conserved. When a representative payee reports conserved funds over $2,000, 
  SSI eligibility is questionable. Therefore, SSA must contact the representative 
  payee to determine continued eligibility. In addition, a large amount of conserved 
  SSI payments may also indicate the representative payee is not spending enough 
  to meet the recipient's needs. <br>
  <br>
  Recent audits found that SSA has not always taken appropriate actions when representative 
  payees report excess conserved funds for SSI recipients. For example, in one 
  case, a representative payee reported $12,562 in conserved funds. However, SSA 
  did not perform the required review, and, as a result, benefits continued uninterrupted.<br>
  <br>
  SCHOOL ATTENDANCE BY STUDENT BENEFICIARIES OVER AGE 18<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the adequacy of SSA's procedures for ensuring student beneficiaries 
  over age 18 are entitled to receive student benefits in accordance with the 
  Social Security Act.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title II of the Act provides benefits to children of insured workers upon the 
  worker's retirement, death, or disability. Generally, child beneficiaries may 
  continue to receive benefits until they marry or reach age 18. Amendments to 
  the Act provide for extended benefits beyond age 18 to enable child beneficiaries 
  who are full-time students at an elementary or secondary school to complete 
  their education.<br>
  <br>
  SSA relies on student beneficiaries to voluntarily report events that may affect 
  their continuing entitlement to benefits. For example, students who attend school 
  part-time or have graduated or dropped out are no longer eligible for benefits. 
  In addition, students who are married, convicted of a crime, or paid by their 
  employer to attend school are no longer eligible for benefits.<br>
  Our prior audit work disclosed that student beneficiaries received incorrect 
  and unsupported payments of $73.9 and $140.4 million, respectively. In response 
  to our audit, in March 2001, SSA revised its forms and reporting requirements, 
  obtained school certification before awarding student benefits, shifted the 
  workload from processing centers to field offices, and provided its employees 
  additional training and guidance.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S ADMINISTRATIVE FINALITY RULES<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the impact of SSA's administrative finality rules on the assessment 
  of overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Once SSA makes determinations regarding SSI or OASDI eligibility or payment 
  amounts, those determinations may be reopened and revised under certain conditions. 
  The rules SSA uses to reopen and revise determinations are known as the rules 
  of administrative finality.<br>
  <br>
  SSA regulations allow a determination to be reopened and revised under the rules 
  of administrative finality under the following conditions:<br>
  within 1 year of the date of notice of an initial determination for any reason; 
  <br>
  after 1 year, but within 2 years for SSI or 4 years for OASDI determinations, 
  upon a finding of &quot;good cause&quot;; or <br>
  at any time, if the determination or decision was procured by fraud or &quot;similar 
  fault.&quot;<br>
  SSA does not consider SSI or OASDI benefit payments issued for any months before 
  the administrative finality time limits to be overpayments, and recovery is 
  not pursued.</p>
<p> THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S CONTROLS OVER SUSPENDING COLLECTION EFFORTS 
  ON TITLE XVI OVERPAYMENTS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To (1) evaluate SSA's controls over suspending collection efforts on Title XVI 
  overpayments because recipients are unable or unwilling to pay, cannot be located, 
  or are out of the country and (2) determine whether the decisions to suspend 
  collection efforts on these overpayments were in accordance with SSA's policies 
  and procedures.<br>
  <br>
  Background <br>
  Title XVI of the Social Security Act established the SSI program in 1972, effective 
  January 1, 1974, to provide income to financially needy individuals who are 
  aged, blind or disabled. SSA relies heavily on beneficiary self-disclosure of 
  all income sources, earned or unearned, as well as computer matching from other 
  Federal and State agencies to verify that information, such as the beneficiary's 
  marital status and/or living arrangements, is correct. The information is used 
  to determine initial eligibility, benefit amounts and periodic benefit redeterminations. 
  Because a beneficiary's SSI determination factors, such as financial status, 
  marital status and living arrangements, may vary over time, SSI payments are 
  error-prone and may result in overpayments.</p>
<p>Recovery of SSI debt is more likely to occur with debtors still eligible for 
  an SSA monthly benefit and typically withheld from a portion of the monthly 
  benefit until the overpayment is repaid. For debtors no longer receiving a monthly 
  benefit, collection efforts are more difficult. The end result is often a decision 
  to write off the debt. Debt write-offs include debts that are waived, which 
  are not subject to future recovery, and debts where the Agency terminates debt 
  collection efforts, which may be subject to future recovery. However, if the 
  write off is deemed suspended from further collection, such as unable or unwilling 
  to pay, unable to locate, or out of the country, the overpayment may be recovered. 
  This suspension allows the Agency to stop unproductive collection efforts while 
  continuing to keep collection options open to a change of events that may lead 
  to collection of the overpayment. These overpayments are left indefinitely in 
  suspended collection status so the Agency may use various collection tools at 
  a future date. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S CONTROLS OVER THE OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND 
  DISABILITY INSURANCE WAIVER APPROVAL PROCESS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA's waiver approval process ensures administrative waivers 
  of $500 or less adequately protect the OASDI program's integrity and waiver 
  decisions exceeding $500 are in accordance with Title II of the Social Security 
  Act. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The OASDI program provides protection against the loss of earnings because of 
  retirement, disability and death. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, 
  the OASDI program provided total benefit payments of $467.5 billion to 46.9 
  million beneficiaries.<br>
  <br>
  Payments in an amount greater than the amount to which an individual is entitled 
  are considered overpayments. When overpayments occur, Agency policies indicate 
  various actions should be taken to collect the amount overpaid. It is SSA's 
  responsibility to identify the overpayment and pursue recovery of the debt. 
  Beneficiaries can seek relief from repaying an overpayment by requesting a waiver. 
  Generally, SSA policy allows field office personnel to waive recovery of an 
  overpayment if the beneficiary is without fault and recovery would &quot;defeat 
  the purpose of Title II&quot; or is &quot;against equity and good conscience.&quot; 
  <br>
  For Fiscal Year 2003, SSA reported in its Report on Receivables Due from the 
  Public approximately $276.8 million in overpayment waivers. Overpayment waivers 
  totaled approximately $67 million for the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance program 
  and $209.8 million for the Disability Insurance program. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S DECISIONS TO TERMINATE COLLECTION EFFORTS 
  FOR OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY INSURANCE OVERPAYMENTS RECORDED ON THE 
  RECOVERY OF OVERPAYMENTS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING SYSTEM <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA's decisions to terminate collection efforts for OASDI 
  overpayments recorded on the Recovery of Overpayments Accounting and Reporting 
  System were in accordance with its policies and procedures.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA administers the OASDI program under Title II of the Social Security Act. 
  The OASDI program provides protection against the loss of earnings due to retirement, 
  disability and death. <br>
  <br>
  Overpayments consist of legally defined and non-legally defined overpayments. 
  Legally defined overpayments are payments of more than the correct amount. For 
  example, a payment is improperly certified to the address of an individual who 
  has the same or similar name as the intended beneficiary. Non-legally defined 
  overpayments are payments not due or received by the beneficiary or were not 
  correctly used for the beneficiary. Non-legally defined overpayments are incorrect 
  or erroneous payments. For example, beneficiary's funds misused by a representative 
  payee. <br>
  <br>
  Agency policies prescribe various actions to be taken to recover overpayments. 
  It is SSA's responsibility to identify the overpayments and pursue recovery 
  of the debt. <br>
  <br>
  SSA may decide to terminate collection efforts after all appropriate collection 
  tools have been used and the debt is considered uncollectible. Although active 
  collection efforts cease, the overpayments are maintained on SSA's Recovery 
  of Overpayments Accounting and Reporting System as inactive debts that may be 
  recovered sometime in the future.</p>
<p> THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S USE OF DEPORTATION DATA<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine how effectively SSA identifies beneficiaries and other individuals 
  who have been deported from the United States.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Each month, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, a component 
  of DHS, notifies SSA of individuals who have been deported from the United States. 
  This notification is required by section 202(n)(2) of the Act and applies to 
  individuals deported under section 241(a) of the 1990 Immigration and Nationality 
  Act.<br>
  <br>
  SSA's Division of Annual Withholding Report receives the United States Citizenship 
  and Immigration Services deportation listing each month, verifies SSNs on the 
  list, and records deportation information on SSA's Disability, Railroad, Alien 
  and Military Service database. As of June 23, 2003, this database contained 
  207,391 deportation records.<br>
  <br>
  Section 202(n) of the Act prohibits SSA from paying Social Security benefits 
  to certain individuals deported from the United States. In addition, SSA cannot 
  make SSI payments to deportees. The law requires that SSA stop both OASDI and 
  SSI payments in the month that United States Citizenship and Immigration Services 
  notifies SSA of the deportation.<br>
  <br>
  UNCOLLECTIBLE TITLE XVI OVERPAYMENTS THAT EXCEED $200<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA properly classified Title XVI overpayments as uncollectible.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title XVI of the Act established the SSI program to provide income to financially 
  needy individuals who are aged, blind or disabled. SSA relies heavily on beneficiary 
  self-disclosure of all financial resources as well as computer matching from 
  other Federal and State agencies. Since an individual's financial resources 
  can vary, SSI payments are error-prone and may result in overpayments. <br>
  <br>
  Under limited circumstances, SSA may deem an overpayment uncollectible. For 
  example, if the beneficiary has filed for bankruptcy or has been declared bankrupt, 
  SSA will deem the overpayments uncollectible. If the beneficiary is deceased 
  and has no surviving spouse or estate, SSA deems any overpayments on this beneficiary's 
  record uncollectible. Also, when specific conditions are met, the Act requires 
  that SSA deem overpayments relating to presumptive disability as uncollectible. 
  <br>
  Title XVI program funds may be lost if overpayments are incorrectly classified 
  as uncollectible. From FY 1998 through 2001, overpayments deemed uncollectible 
  increased from $99 to $150 million, a 51-percent increase.<br>
  <br>
  UNDETECTED OVERPAYMENTS IN THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S DISABILITY PROGRAMS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To quantify the amount of undetected overpayments in SSA's disability programs.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  On September 4, 2003, we received a request from Senator Charles Grassley to 
  further analyze the improper payment prevalence in SSA's disability programs.<br>
  <br>
  SSA pays disability benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security 
  Act. In FY 2002, SSA paid approximately $97.2 billion in benefits under the 
  DI and SSI programs and assessed about $2.9 billion in overpayments. However, 
  based on our prior studies of SSA, other Federal agencies, and private disability 
  insurers, we believe about 10 percent of SSA's disability benefit payments could 
  be at-risk for undetected overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  Internal Control Environment and Performance Measures <br>
  <br>
  Internal control comprises the plans, methods, and procedures used to meet missions, 
  goals, and objectives. Internal controls help safeguard assets and prevent and 
  detect errors and fraud. Assessing the internal control environment is important 
  since internal control is a critical part of performance-based management. SSA's 
  internal control environment helps its managers achieve desired results through 
  effective stewardship of public resources. <br>
  <br>
  SSA is responsible for implementing policies for the development of disability 
  claims under the DI and SSI programs. Disability determinations under both DI 
  and SSI are performed by DDSs in each State in accordance with Federal regulations. 
  In carrying out its obligation, each DDS is responsible for determining claimants' 
  disabilities and ensuring adequate evidence is available to support its determinations. 
  To assist in making proper disability determinations, each DDS is authorized 
  to purchase medical examinations, x-rays, and laboratory tests on a consultative 
  basis to supplement evidence obtained from the claimants' physicians or other 
  treating sources. There are 52 DDSs located in each of the 50 States, the District 
  of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. SSA reimburses the DDS for 100 percent of allowable 
  expenditures up to its approved funding authorization. In FY 2003, SSA allocated 
  over $1.6 billion to fund DDS operations. <br>
  <br>
  During FYs 2000 through 2003, we conducted 15 DDS administrative cost audits. 
  In 13 of the 15 audits, internal control weaknesses were identified. For example, 
  we reported that improvements were needed to ensure Federal funds were properly 
  drawn and payments to medical providers were in accordance with Federal regulations. 
  The lack of effective internal controls can result in the mismanagement of Federal 
  resources and increase the risk of fraud.</p>
<p>In 6 of the 15 DDS administrative cost audits, we reported unallowable indirect 
  costs totaling about $12.3 million. As a result, we initiated a separate review 
  of SSA's oversight of indirect costs. We reported that SSA needed to improve 
  its oversight of indirect costs claimed by DDSs to ensure SSA funds obligated 
  by DDSs through the indirect cost process benefited SSA's disability programs 
  and the costs were equitably distributed to its programs.z</p>
<p>Congress, external interested parties, and the general public need sound data 
  to monitor and evaluate SSA's performance. SSA relies primarily on internally 
  generated data to manage the information it uses to administer its programs 
  and report to Congress and the public. The necessity for good internal data 
  Government wide has resulted in the passage of several laws, including the Government 
  Performance and Results Act. In addition to the legislation calling for greater 
  accountability within the Government, the PMA has focused on the integration 
  of the budget and performance measurement processes. The PMA calls for agencies 
  to, over time, identify high quality outcome measures, accurately monitor the 
  performance of programs, and begin integrating this presentation with associated 
  cost.<br>
  <br>
  SSA sets forth its mission and strategic goals in strategic plans, establishes 
  yearly targets in its annual performance plan, and reports on its performance 
  annually. Each year, we conduct audits to assess the internal control environment 
  over SSA's performance measures. The objective of this work is to assess the 
  reliability of SSA's performance data and evaluate the extent to which SSA's 
  performance measures describe its planned and actual performance meaningfully.<br>
  <br>
  Assessing the control environment over DDSs and SSA's performance measures helps 
  to ensure that the Agency is properly managing its resources to meet it mission. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2005, we plan to complete 19 reviews and begin 11 reviews in this area. 
  We also plan to oversee the reviews of 16 performance measures.</p>
<p>We Plan to Complete the Following Reviews in FY 2005Administrative Costs Claimed 
  by State Disability Determinations Services: 11 reviews to be conducted in Alaska,

<p>ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS CLAIMED BY STATE DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES<br>
  We will be conducting reviews in the following State DDSs<br>
  <br>
  Alaska<br>
  Arkansas<br>
  Delaware<br>
  District of Columbia<br>
  Iowa<br>
  New Hampshire<br>
  North Carolina<br>
  Ohio<br>
  Pennsylvania<br>
  South Dakota<br>
  Wisconsin <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  The objectives of the DDS administrative cost audits are to evaluate the DDS' 
  internal controls over the accounting and reporting of administrative costs, 
  determine whether costs claimed by the DDSs were allowable and properly allocated 
  and funds were properly drawn, and assess the general security controls environment.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The DI program was established in 1956 under Title II of the Act. The program 
  is designed to provide benefits to wage earners and their families in the event 
  the wage earner becomes disabled. In 1972, the Congress enacted the SSI program 
  (Public Law 92-603). The SSI program provides a nationally uniform program of 
  income to financially needy individuals who are aged, blind or disabled. Disability 
  determinations under both DI and SSI are performed by a DDS in each State or 
  other responsible jurisdiction in accordance with Federal regulations. In carrying 
  out its obligation, each DDS is responsible for determining the claimants' disabilities 
  and ensuring adequate evidence is available to support its determinations. SSA 
  reimburses DDSs for their allowable administrative costs.<br>
  <br>
  COSTS INCURRED BY MAXIMUS, INC., ON CONTRACT NUMBER 0600-00-60020<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To review the direct and indirect costs charged by Maximus on this contract.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 was enacted to 
  enable disabled beneficiaries to receive a ticket to obtain employment services, 
  vocational rehabilitation services, or other support services from an approved 
  provider of their choice, called an Employment Network. The Employment Network 
  can be a private organization or public agency that agrees to work with SSA 
  to provide Vocational Rehabilitation, employment, and other support services 
  to assist beneficiaries to work. <br>
  <br>
  Maximus, Inc., was selected as the Program Manager and is responsible for administering 
  most aspects of the ticket program, including recruiting and managing Employment 
  Networks and managing the ticket process. During the initial 24-month period 
  a beneficiary is using his/her ticket, there is no requirement for work. However, 
  the beneficiary must be participating in an employment plan. At the conclusion 
  of the initial 24-month period, the Program Manager will conduct a progress 
  review to determine whether the beneficiary is meeting the guidelines and still 
  using a ticket. The Program Manager will then conduct annual progress reviews 
  at the end of each 12-month period. </p>
<p> FISCAL YEAR 2004 FINANCIAL STATEMENT AUDIT OVERSIGHT<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To fulfill our responsibilities under the Chief Financial Officers Act and related 
  legislation for ensuring the quality of the audit work performed, we will monitor 
  PricewaterhouseCoopers' (PwC) audit of SSA's FY 2004 financial statements.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 requires that agencies annually prepare 
  audited financial statements. Each agency's Inspector General is responsible 
  for auditing these financial statements to determine whether they provide a 
  fair representation of the entity's financial position. This annual audit also 
  includes an assessment of the Agency's internal control structure and its compliance 
  with laws and regulations. PwC will perform the audit work to support this opinion 
  of SSA's financial statements. We will monitor the contract to ensure the reliability 
  of PwC's work to meet our statutory requirements for auditing the Agency's financial 
  statements.<br>
  <br>
  FISCAL YEAR 2004 INSPECTOR GENERAL STATEMENT ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S 
  MAJOR MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To summarize and assess SSA's progress in addressing the most serious management 
  and performance challenges.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In November 2000, the President signed the Reports Consolidation Act of 2000, 
  which requires that Inspectors General provide a summary and assessment of the 
  most serious management and performance challenges facing the agencies and the 
  agencies' progress in addressing these challenges. <br>
  <br>
  We identified the following management challenges in FY 2004.<br>
  Social Security Number Integrity and Protection <br>
  Management of the Disability Process<br>
  Improper Payments <br>
  Budget and Performance Integration<br>
  Critical Infrastructure Protection/Systems Security<br>
  Service Delivery <br>
  We will summarize each challenge and document actions SSA has taken to address 
  it.<br>
  <br>
  INDEPENDENT LIVING RESOURCE CENTER OF NORTH EAST FLORIDA<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA's funds are being used in accordance with the terms 
  of the grant.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Ticket program) 
  improves access to employment training and placement services for people with 
  disabilities who want to work. Under the Ticket program, eligible beneficiaries 
  can receive employment services, vocational services, or other support services 
  to help them return to work. The Ticket program provides the beneficiary the 
  opportunity to choose from a variety of employment networks. The employment 
  networks may be public or private organizations that contract with SSA to provide 
  employment services to eligible beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  In addition, SSA's Office of Employment Support Programs' Benefits Planning, 
  Assistance and Outreach Program approves and allocates grant money to public 
  and private organizations to assist eligible beneficiaries in making informed 
  choices about returning to work. In July 2001, the Benefits Planning, Assistance 
  and Outreach program awarded a cooperative agreement to the Independent Living 
  Resource Center of Northeast Florida, which covers five counties in Florida: 
  Nassau, Baker, Clay, Duval, and St. Johns. Over the first 3 years of the grant, 
  the Center received $236,304. <br>
  Our audit will focus on reviewing the direct and indirect costs claimed on this 
  grant.<br>
  <br>
  INDIRECT COSTS CLAIMED BY STATE DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES<br>
  We will conduct indirect cost reviews in the following States.<br>
  Arizona<br>
  New Jersey<br>
  Oregon<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To review the State DDS' indirect costs to determine whether the costs claimed 
  on the SSA financial reports (State Agency Report of Obligations for SSA Disability 
  Programs, Form SSA-4513) are allowable and properly allocated. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The DI program was established in 1956 under Title II of the Act. The DI program 
  provides benefits to wage earners and their families in the event the wage earner 
  becomes disabled. In 1972, Congress enacted the SSI program (Public Law 92-603). 
  The SSI program provides a nationally uniform program of income to financially 
  needy individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled. Disability determinations 
  under the DI and SSI programs are performed by an agency in each State in accordance 
  with Federal regulations. In carrying out its obligation, each State agency 
  is responsible for determining the claimants' disabilities and ensuring that 
  adequate evidence is available to support its determinations. SSA reimburses 
  State DDSs for allowable expenditures.<br>
  <br>
  WESTAT CONTRACT CLOSEOUT ON CONTRACT NUMBER 0600-99-36200<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the allowability of the direct costs and apply the final indirect 
  rates to compute the total allowable contract costs submitted.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Westat was awarded contract 0600-99-36200 on December 21, 1998. This $23.4 million 
  cost-plus-fixed-fee contract was awarded to conduct a Disability Evaluation 
  Study/National Study of Health and Activity. The Disability Evaluation Study 
  is a major research effort to understand the prevalence of disability and the 
  potential for growth in SSA's disability rolls and to understand what enables 
  &quot;disabled&quot; individuals to remain in the workplace. Through the Disability 
  Evaluation Study, SSA would estimate how many adults in the U.S. population 
  would meet eligibility criteria for Social Security disability benefits, how 
  many of them work despite their impairments, and which factors enable them to 
  work. Through three additional funding modifications, as of August 9, 2001, 
  the contract value was increased to $39.3 million.<br>
  <br>
  However, on October 22, 2002, the contract was terminated because of a shift 
  in SSA's budget and project management prioritization goals. On February 28, 
  2003, SSA deobligated the excess funds and modified the contract value to $19.9 
  million. On January 16, 2004, Westat submitted its settlement proposal. On March 
  30, 2004, Westat submitted its final completion voucher. The final completion 
  voucher included all costs claimed from December 21, 1998 through March 25, 
  2003.</p>
<p></p>
<p> PERFORMANCE INDICATOR AUDITS: AUDITS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S 
  PERFORMANCE DATA<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the reliability of the performance data SSA uses to measure selected 
  performance indicators.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 to bring 
  greater accountability to Federal agencies. The Government Performance and Results 
  Act established a system for strategic and annual performance planning and reporting 
  to set goals for program performance and to measure results. The law requires 
  that each agency create (1) 5-year strategic plans, (2) annual performance plans, 
  and (3) annual performance reports. SSA released its latest strategic plan in 
  2003, which covers FYs 2003-2008. The Agency's most recent annual performance 
  plan presents 4 strategic goals in its strategic plan and 47 Government Performance 
  and Results Act performance measures.<br>
  <br>
  The success of SSA's performance measurement initiatives hinges on the quality 
  of the data used to measure and report program performance. Consequently, it 
  is important that SSA have assurance that the data reported are reliable and 
  meaningful and that its performance report will be useful to Congress and Agency 
  management.<br>
  <br>
  During FY 2005, we will review the following performance indicators.<br>
  Number of appellate actions processed <br>
  Number of initial disability claims pending <br>
  Number of SSA hearings pending <br>
  Hearings decision accuracy rate<br>
  Retirement and Survivor Insurance claims processed <br>
  Percent of people who do business with SSA rating the overall service as &quot;excellent,&quot; 
  &quot;very good,&quot; or &quot;good&quot; <br>
  SSI nondisability redeterminations <br>
  Periodic continuing disability reviews processed <br>
  Percent of outstanding SSI debt in a collection arrangement <br>
  Percent of outstanding OASDI debt in a collection arrangement <br>
  SSN requests processed <br>
  Percent of SSNs issued that are free of critical error <br>
  Annual earnings items processed <br>
  Number of job enrichment opportunities (includes Headquarters component and 
  regional development programs)<br>
  Number of SSA hearings cases processed per workyear <br>
  Percent of SSI Aged claims processed by the time the first payment is due or 
  within 14 days of the effective filing date</p>
<p> Critical Infrastructure Protection and Systems Security<br>
  <br>
  Today, the growth in computer interconnectivity brings a heightened risk of 
  disrupting or sabotaging critical operations, reading or copying sensitive data, 
  and tampering with critical processes. Those who wish to disrupt or sabotage 
  critical operations have more tools than ever. The United States works to protect 
  the people, economy, essential services, and national security by ensuring that 
  any disruptions are infrequent, manageable, of minimal duration, and cause the 
  least damage possible. The Government must continually strive to secure information 
  systems for critical infrastructures. Protection of these systems is essential 
  to telecommunications, energy, financial services, manufacturing, water, transportation, 
  health care, and emergency services. <br>
  <br>
  SSA's information security challenge is to understand and mitigate system vulnerabilities. 
  At SSA, this means ensuring the security of its critical information infrastructure, 
  such as access to the Internet and its networks. By improving systems security 
  and controls, SSA will be able to use current and future technology more effectively 
  to fulfill the public's needs. The public will not use electronic access to 
  SSA services if it does not believe those systems are secure. SSA addresses 
  critical information infrastructure and systems security in a variety of ways. 
  For example, it has created a Critical Infrastructure Protection work group 
  that works toward compliance with various directives, such as the Homeland Security 
  Presidential Directives and the Federal Information Security Management Act 
  of 2002. SSA has several other components throughout the organization that handle 
  systems security, including the Office of Information Technology Security Policy 
  within the Office of the Chief Information Officer. <br>
  <br>
  Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 requires that all Federal departments 
  and agency heads identify, prioritize, assess, remediate, and protect their 
  respective critical infrastructure and key resources. OMB provided guidance 
  to Federal departments and agencies on how to prepare plans to protect physical 
  and cyber critical infrastructure and key resources and to complete these plans 
  by July 31, 2004. We have worked closely with SSA to help meet these requirements. 
  The Agency plans must address identification, prioritization, protection, and 
  contingency planning, including the recovery and reconstitution of essential 
  capabilities. <br>
  <br>
  One important issue in systems security is restricting physical access to the 
  Agency's systems and data. We reported on physical security problems at several 
  hearing offices and noted that non-SSA employees were allowed inappropriate 
  access to secured areas. Though the managers at these sites took prompt action 
  to remedy the security breaches, we believe the same security concerns may be 
  present at other hearing offices. However, because our observations were limited 
  to only a few offices, we do not know how pervasive these security breaches 
  may be. We plan to better assess OHA's vulnerabilities in this area. <br>
  <br>
  In addition, under the Federal Information Security Management Act, we independently 
  evaluate SSA's security program. We also monitor the Agency's efforts and progress 
  on the Expanded Electronic Government initiative of the PMA. Systems security 
  is a key component of this initiative, and we are working with the Agency to 
  resolve outstanding issues so it can get to green on the Electronic Government 
  Scorecard.<br>
  <br>
  In FY 2005, we plan to complete 14 reviews and begin 6 reviews in this area.<br>
  <br>
  We Plan to Complete the Following Reviews in FY 2005<br>

<p></p>
<p>ACCESS TO SECURED AREAS IN HEARING OFFICES-REGIONS I THROUGH X<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess controls over physical security in hearing offices.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  OHA is one of the largest administrative adjudicative systems in the world. 
  At the hearing level, the Chief Administrative Law Judge manages 10 regional 
  offices and 140 hearing offices. In FY 2003, approximately 1,000 administrative 
  law judges rendered about 500,000 decisions at the hearing level. Claims folders 
  containing sensitive information about claimants, such as SSNs and private medical 
  information, are stored, reviewed and moved through the hearing offices. <br>
  <br>
  OHA must ensure its employees, facilities, and records are safeguarded against 
  security threats. OHA has policies and procedures for physical security to safeguard 
  hearing office access, protect Government property, and protect on-site personnel 
  and sensitive data. In March 2004, we issued an early alert to the Commissioner 
  concerning problems we observed involving security issues in six hearing offices 
  while conducting other audits. Based on our previous audit findings, we are 
  concerned about the physical security at hearing offices. As a result, we will 
  review the physical security at 20 hearing offices-2 in each of SSA's 10 Regions.</p>
<p> ASSESSING THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S DISABILITY CONTROL FILE APPLICATION 
  CONTROLS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the application controls of the Disability Control File. This audit 
  will encompass the three phases of the processing cycle (input, processing, 
  and output) to ensure that Disability Control File transactions are authorized, 
  complete and accurate. The audit will include the determination of whether (1) 
  requests for data and use of data are authorized, (2) data are accurate and 
  valid; (3) data are properly processed; and (4) output data are accurate, valid 
  and distributed to authorized users.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 provides for 
  support of those disabled beneficiaries who want to return to work and subsequently 
  leave the disability benefit rolls. Nearly all of the data that describe the 
  activity for those beneficiaries that attempt to work will be controlled in 
  the Disability Control File. These data and related software are commonly referred 
  to as the Ticket to Work program functions.<br>
  <br>
  The Disability Control File replaces the CDR Control File as the disability 
  database for both Title II and Title XVI records and will be expanded to house 
  records for all disabled individuals, including claim information by SSN. In 
  addition to information available on the CDR Control File for records selected 
  for a medical CDR, or records selected for eligibility for the Ticket to Work 
  program, the new Disability Control File will allow technicians to add both 
  medical and work CDRs initiated in the field office or processing center.<br>
  <br>
  The Disability Control File will consolidate all data needed to control and 
  process all types of disabled beneficiary medical and work CDRs. The Disability 
  Control File allows for the processing of all aspects of a CDR from initiation 
  to disposition using data from a single source. The Disability Control File 
  will also control any subsequent reviews for those individuals who are determined 
  to still be disabled after the CDR is complete. <br>
  <br>
  Establishment of the Disability Control File is a major step in SSA's effort 
  to perform required CDRs timely and accurately. As of July 2004, about 10.6 
  million Americans were receiving DI/SSI-related disability benefits.<br>
  <br>
  DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES PROCEDURES FOR REMOVING SENSITIVE INFORMATION 
  FROM EXCESS COMPUTERS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To examine the policies and procedures the State DDSs follow when excessing 
  computer equipment to ensure sensitive information is removed.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The DDSs are State agencies responsible for developing medical evidence and 
  rendering the initial determination on whether an SSA disability claimant is 
  legally disabled or blind. As such, computer equipment within the DDSs store 
  such sensitive information as a claimant's SSN, medical and other personal information.<br>
  <br>
  The North Carolina State Auditors reviewed a sample of machines that had been 
  excessed by a variety of state agencies and found files on those machines were 
  accessible, including password files and other sensitive information. Some of 
  these machines were from the Department of Health and Human Services, which 
  is the parent agency for the North Carolina DDS.<br>
  The DDS Security Document directs DDSs to run the SSA WipeDisk utility on equipment 
  used for the storage of sensitive information (servers, personal computers, 
  laptops, etc.) before its disposal or donation to another entity. <br>
  <br>
  FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA is in compliance with the Federal Information Security 
  Management Act for FY 2005.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 requires an Agency-wide 
  information security program and annual reviews of the security program performed 
  by the Agency and by the OIG, separately. Each year, OMB issues questions to 
  be answered concerning agencies' compliance with the Federal Information Security 
  Management Act.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S PATCH MANAGEMENT PROCESS<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA implements and performs effective patch management 
  practices and whether the necessary steps are taken to mitigate the risks created 
  by software vulnerabilities.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in software that can be exploited by a malicious 
  entity to gain greater access and/or permission than it is authorized to have 
  on the computer. A patch is a piece of software code that is inserted into a 
  program to temporarily fix a defect. Patches are developed and released by software 
  vendors when vulnerabilities are discovered. Timely patching is critical to 
  maintain the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information 
  technology systems. However, failure to keep operating system and application 
  software patched can create a weakness. <br>
  <br>
  A recent GAO report noted that agencies generally are implementing important 
  common practices for effective patch management, such as performing systems 
  inventories and providing information security training. However, they are not 
  consistently performing others, such as risk assessments and testing all patches 
  before deployment. According to this report, agencies face several challenges 
  to implement effective patch management practices, including (1) quickly installing 
  patches while implementing effective patch management practices, (2) patching 
  heterogeneous systems, (3) ensuring that mobile systems receive the latest patches, 
  (4) avoiding unacceptable downtime when patching high-availability systems, 
  and (5) dedicating sufficient resources to patch management.</p>
<p> Service Delivery <br>
  One of SSA's goals is to deliver high-quality, &quot;citizen-centered&quot; 
  service. This goal encompasses traditional and electronic services to applicants 
  for benefits, beneficiaries and the general public. It includes services to 
  and from States, other agencies, third parties, employers, and other organizations, 
  including financial institutions and medical providers. This area includes basic 
  operational services, and two of the greatest challenges in the area are the 
  representative payee process and managing human capital.<br>
  <br>
  Representative Payee Challenges <br>
  When SSA determines a beneficiary cannot manage his/her benefits, SSA selects 
  a representative payee who must use the payments for the beneficiary's needs. 
  There are about 5.4 million representative payees who manage benefit payments 
  for 6.8 million beneficiaries. While representative payees provide a valuable 
  service for beneficiaries, SSA must provide appropriate safeguards to ensure 
  they meet their responsibilities to the beneficiaries they serve.<br>
  We have completed several audits of representative payees. Our audits have identified 
  deficiencies with the accounting for benefit receipts and disbursements, vulnerabilities 
  in the safeguarding of beneficiary payments, poor monitoring and reporting to 
  SSA of changes in beneficiary circumstances, inappropriate handling of beneficiary-conserved 
  funds, and improper charging of fees.<br>
  <br>
  In March 2004, the President signed into law the Social Security Protection 
  Act of 2004. This Act provides several new safeguards for those individuals 
  who need a representative payee. In addition, it presents significant challenges 
  to SSA to ensure representative payees meet beneficiaries' needs. For example, 
  it requires that SSA conduct periodic on-site reviews of representative payees 
  and a statistically valid survey to determine how payments made to representative 
  payees are being used. It also authorizes SSA to impose civil monetary penalties 
  for offenses involving misuse of benefits received by a representative payee. 
</p>
<p>Human Capital Challenges<br>
  SSA, like many other Federal agencies, is being challenged to address its human 
  capital shortfalls. In January 2001, GAO added strategic human capital management 
  to its list of high-risk Federal programs and operations. In addition, Strategic 
  Management of Human Capital is one of five Government-wide initiatives contained 
  in the PMA. </p>
<p>By the end of 2012, SSA projects its DI and Old-Age and Survivors Insurance 
  benefit rolls will increase by 35 percent and 18 percent, respectively. At the 
  same time, 59 percent of SSA's employees will be eligible to retire. This retirement 
  wave will result in a loss of institutional knowledge that will affect SSA's 
  ability to deliver quality service to the public. <br>
  Along with the workload increase, the incredible pace of technological change 
  will have a profound impact on both the public's expectations and SSA's ability 
  to meet those expectations. In the face of these challenges, technology is essential 
  to achieving efficiencies and enabling employees to deliver the kind of service 
  that every claimant, beneficiary and citizen needs and deserves.<br>
  <br>
  The critical loss of institutional skills and knowledge, combined with greatly 
  increased workloads at a time when the baby-boom generation will require its 
  services must be addressed by succession planning, strong recruitment efforts, 
  and the effective use of technology.<br>
  <br>
  SSA continues to score &quot;green&quot; in &quot;Progress in Implementing the 
  President's Management Agenda&quot; on the OMB Scorecard and, in July 2004, 
  improved its rating in &quot;Status&quot; from &quot;yellow&quot; to &quot;green.&quot; 
  <br>
  In FY 2005, we plan to complete 18 reviews and begin 11 reviews in this area.</p>

  SSA beneficiaries from having different payees under separate programs.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA pays benefits under the Title II and XVI programs. Most beneficiaries receive 
  benefits from only one program. Concurrently entitled beneficiaries, however, 
  receive benefits from both programs.<br>
  <br>
  Under either program, when a beneficiary cannot manage or direct the management 
  of his/her benefits, a representative payee is appointed. SSA's policy requires 
  that one payee be appointed for all benefits to which the individual is entitled, 
  unless there is some compelling reason to do otherwise. Also, personnel must 
  document each claims file with the reason for naming different payees in rare 
  instances where different payees are appointed. Where different payees are appointed, 
  field offices should prepare a diary for a manual accounting report to be obtained 
  on the Title II claim, when appropriate, because the system only sends an accounting 
  report to the Title XVI payee.<br>
  <br>
  In a prior review, we found differing payee arrangements, incomplete accounting, 
  and inaccuracies in SSA's data.<br>
  <br>
  EFFECTS OF STAFFING ON HEARING OFFICE PERFORMANCE<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To examine how staffing affects hearing office performance in the areas of productivity 
  and timeliness.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  OHA makes decisions on appealed determinations involving retirement, survivors, 
  disability, and SSI payments. OHA is headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia. 
  Within OHA, the Office of the Chief Administrative Law Judge administers the 
  nationwide hearings organization and the Chief Administrative Law Judge is the 
  principal consultant and advisor to the Associate Commissioner on all matters 
  concerning the administrative law judge hearing process. <br>
  <br>
  In our report, Best Practices in the Highest Producing Hearing Offices, we highlighted 
  the best practices used by OHA's most productive hearing offices. In this report, 
  we will discuss our findings on how staffing affects hearing office performance 
  in terms of productivity and timeliness.<br>
  <br>
  NATION-WIDE SURVEY OF INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY 
  ADMINISTRATION AND REGIONS I THROUGH X<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether individual representative payees used Social Security benefits 
  received for the care and well being of the beneficiaries they serve.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Some individuals cannot manage or direct the management of their finances because 
  of their youth or mental and/or physical impairments. Congress granted SSA the 
  authority to appoint representative payees to receive and manage these beneficiaries' 
  benefit payments. A representative payee may be an individual or an organization. 
  SSA selects representative payees for OASDI beneficiaries and SSI recipients 
  when representative payments would serve the individual's interests. <br>
  This is a nation-wide review of individual representative payees serving fewer 
  than 15 beneficiaries. In addition, we will issue separate reports to each Regional 
  Commissioner summarizing the results of our review in their respective regions.<br>
  <br>
  REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES RECEIVING BENEFIT PAYMENTS FOR BENEFICIARIES THEY DO NOT 
  SERVE AS THE OFFICIAL PAYEE<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the extent of representative payees who are managing beneficiary 
  payments for whom they are not the representative payee. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In three prior audits, we determined that representative payees endorsed and 
  deposited benefit payment checks of beneficiaries for whom they were not the 
  representative payee.<br>
  <br>
  Some individuals cannot manage or direct the management of their finances because 
  of their youth or mental and/or physical impairments. Congress granted SSA the 
  authority to appoint representative payees to receive and manage these beneficiaries' 
  benefit payments. A representative payee may be an individual or an organization. 
  SSA selects representative payees for OASDI beneficiaries and SSI recipients 
  when representative payments would serve the individual's interests. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S OFFICE OF SYSTEMS' TRAINING PROGRAM<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate the Office of Systems' process for providing training to current 
  staff and new hires. Specifically, we will review the allocation of training 
  opportunities, types, and cost of training provided to current Office of Systems 
  staff and new hires to enhance skills/competencies needed to meet future workloads.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Technology is the foundation of the Agency's current and future ability to provide 
  quality service in the face of a significant increase in workloads and the loss 
  of experienced staff. <br>
  <br>
  For SSA to meet its customers' future needs, it must restructure its systems' 
  processes to make effective use of new technologies and ensure it has staff 
  trained on the application of those technologies. Technologies expected to be 
  commonplace in 2010 include a rapidly evolving Internet, advances involving 
  speech and video, and a wide range of wireless, portable, connective devices.	
  <br>
  <br>
  In January 2003, GAO issued a report on the Major Management Challenges and 
  Program Risks: Social Security Administration. That report stated &quot;As SSA 
  places increased emphasis on using information technology to support new ways 
  of delivering service, it must also ensure that it effectively manages its human 
  capital to anticipate, plan for, and support its requirements&#133;<br>
  <br>
  doing so is necessary to ensure that SSA's plans project workforce needs far 
  enough in advance to allow adequate time for staff recruitment and hiring, skills 
  refreshment and training, or outsourcing considerations&#133;&quot;<br>
  The Office of Systems guides and manages the development, acquisition, and use 
  of SSA's information technology resources. These resources support the Agency's 
  programmatic and business functions. Within the Division of Process Engineering, 
  Project, and Customer Service, the Systems Training and Communications Branch, 
  manages and administers the Office of Systems' Technical Training Program. <br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION'S PROCEDURES FOR ADDRESSING EMPLOYEE-RELATED 
  ALLEGATIONS-REGIONS I, VII, AND X<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate the adequacy of SSA's policies and procedures for addressing employee-related 
  allegations, determine how well SSA complied with those policies and procedures, 
  and determine whether SSA actually referred all employee-related allegations 
  that should have been referred to the OIG.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Every year, SSA receives various types of allegations related to its programs 
  and the misuse of Social Security numbers. While SSA may receive allegations 
  directly, we also refer allegations to SSA that we receive through our Hotline. 
  For FYs 2000 through 2002, we referred 876 employee-related allegations to SSA. 
  Of this number, 665 were sent to SSA's regional offices.<br>
  Allegations concerning employees are significant because of the potential losses 
  to SSA's programs and the corresponding negative public impact such issues can 
  cause SSA. Our review will focus on the development and resolution of our referrals 
  of employee-related allegations sent to the Boston, Kansas City, and Seattle 
  Regional Offices during FYs 2000 through 2002 and on allegations or instances 
  of employee misconduct brought to the attention of the Regional Offices through 
  other sources. <br>
