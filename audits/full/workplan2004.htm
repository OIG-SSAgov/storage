  <br>
  OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL MISSION<br>
  We improve SSA&#8217;s programs and operations and protect them against fraud, 
  waste, and abuse by conducting independent and objective audits, evaluations, 
  and investigations. We provide timely, useful, and reliable information and 
  advice to Administration officials, the Congress, and the public.<br>
  <br>
  THE OFFICE OF AUDIT<br>
  We conduct comprehensive audits and evaluations of SSA&#8217;s programs and 
  operations. Our audits determine whether the objectives of SSA&#8217;s programs 
  are being achieved and identify which programs or activities need to be performed 
  more efficiently. In FY 2003, we issued 97 reports containing recommendations 
  with about $417 million in Federal funds to be put to better use and about $57 
  million in questioned costs. <br>
  <br>
  ANNUAL WORK PLAN<br>
  Our Annual Work Plan (Plan) outlines our perspective of the top management challenges 
  facing SSA and serves as a tool for communicating our priorities to SSA, the 
  Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and other interested parties. 
  The activities described address the fundamental goals related to SSA&#8217;s 
  mission to administer the Social Security programs and operations effectively 
  and efficiently. Our work is prioritized to focus our resources on those areas 
  that are most vulnerable to fraud, waste and abuse. To ensure the OIG provides 
  a coordinated effort, we work closely with the Offices of Investigations, Counsel 
  to the Inspector General, and Executive Operations. <br>
  <br>
  Our Plan is categorized to mirror the top management challenges that cut across 
  the Government, as outlined in the President&#8217;s Management Agenda (PMA) 
  and rated by OMB&#8217;s Scorecard.<br>
  <br>
  The PMA was designed to coordinate agency efforts to &#8220;address the most 
  apparent deficiencies and focus resources where the opportunity to improve performance 
  is the greatest.&#8221; The PMA&#8217;s goal is to establish a more responsible 
  and responsive Government that is citizen-centered, results-oriented, and market-based. 
  In addition to the PMA, OMB provides each Federal agency with a scorecard rating 
  their performance. The scorecard is designed around a simple grading system: 
  green for success, yellow for mixed results, and red for unsatisfactory. Below 
  is the status of SSA&#8217;s efforts, as reported by OMB&#8217;s June 2003 Scorecard.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although the challenges 
  facing SSA management in FY 2004 have not changed substantially from last year, 
  we have recategorized or renamed some issue areas. <br>
  <br>
  &#8226; The areas formerly titled Homeland Security, Social Security Number 
  Integrity and Misuse and Integrity of the Earnings Reporting Process have been 
  combined under one area titled Social Security Number Integrity and Protection. 
  <br>
  <br>
  &#8226; The Human Capital, E-Government, and Representative Payee issue areas 
  previously included as separate challenges are now combined under the Service 
  Delivery issue area. <br>
  <br>
  &#8226; The Fraud Risk issue area has been removed, and we have noted in each 
  write-up that there are certain elements of fraud risk in each management challenge.<br>
  <br>
  This Plan describes 101 reviews we intend to complete and 71 reviews we intend 
  to begin in FY 2004 in the following issue areas. <br>

  &#8226; Service Delivery <br>
  <br>
  The following table demonstrates that our perspective is congruent with other 
  key decisionmakers. <br>
  <br>
  To assist us in this analysis, we crosswalked the PMA, Commissioner Priorities, 
  Social Security Advisory Board, and General Accounting Office (GAO) high-risk 
  areas to those identified by our prior and ongoing work. <br>
  <br>
  In preparing this Plan, we solicited suggestions from the Agency. We received 
  a number of suggestions for inclusion in our Plan, and we have incorporated 
  as many of them as possible.<br>
  <br>
  We recognize this Plan is dynamic, so we encourage continuous feedback and additional 
  suggestions. This flexibility enables us to meet emerging and critical issues 
  evolving throughout the upcoming year.<br>

  Social Security Number Integrity and Protection <br>
  In FY 2003, SSA issued about 17 million original and replacement SSN cards, 
  and SSA received approximately $541 billion in employment taxes related to earnings 
  under issued SSNs. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2003, SSA issued about 17 million original and replacement SSN cards, 
  and SSA received approximately $541 billion in employment taxes related to earnings 
  under issued SSNs. Protecting the SSN and properly posting the wages reported 
  under SSNs are critical to ensuring eligible individuals receive the full retirement, 
  survivor and/or disability benefits due them. <br>
  <br>
  The SSN is the single most widely used identifier for Federal and State governments 
  and the private sector. It has become the de facto national identifier. Given 
  its importance, the possession of an SSN may allow criminals to steal identities 
  and commit other criminal acts. In fact, the lack of protection of the SSN has 
  often led to identity theft and SSN misuse. Being the immediate victim of SSN 
  misuse and/or identity theft may cause individuals years of difficulty and cost 
  financial and commercial institutions a great deal of money. SSN misuse may 
  disguise a dangerous felon or a terrorist as a law-abiding citizen. The possession 
  of an SSN provides a criminal the identification and seeming legitimacy he or 
  she needs to go about nefarious business, perhaps putting dozens, hundreds, 
  or even thousands of lives in jeopardy. <br>
  <br>
  Protecting the Social Security Number<br>
  To ensure the integrity of the SSN, SSA must focus on three stages of protection: 
  (1) when the SSN card is issued, (2) during the life of the SSN cardholder, 
  and (3) upon the SSN cardholder&#8217;s death. Furthermore, SSA must employ 
  effective front-end controls in its enumeration process. Likewise, additional 
  techniques, such as data mining, biometrics, and enhanced systems controls, 
  are critical in the fight against SSN misuse.<br>
  <br>
  To effectively combat SSN misuse, we believe SSA should <br>
  <br>
  &#8226; establish a reasonable threshold for the number of replacement SSN cards 
  an individual may obtain during a year and over a lifetime,<br>
  &#8226; expedite systems controls that would interrupt SSN assignment when SSA 
  mails multiple cards to common addresses or when parents claim an improbably 
  large number of children,<br>
  &#8226; continue to address identified weaknesses within its information security 
  environment to better safeguard SSNs, and<br>
  &#8226; continue to educate SSA staff about counterfeit documents.<br>
  <br>
  Integrity of the Earnings Process<br>
  The integrity of the SSN is also related to SSA&#8217;s process for posting 
  workers&#8217; earnings. If earnings information is reported incorrectly or 
  not reported at all, SSA cannot ensure all eligible individuals are receiving 
  the correct payment amounts. In addition, SSA&#8217;s disability programs under 
  the Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) provisions 
  depend on this earnings information to determine (1) whether an individual is 
  eligible for benefits and (2) the amount of the disability payment. <br>
  <br>
  SSA spends scarce resources trying to correct the earnings data when incorrect 
  information is reported. <br>
  <br>
  The Earnings Suspense File (ESF) is the Agency&#8217;s record of annual wage 
  reports for which wage earners&#8217; names and SSNs fail to match SSA&#8217;s 
  records. Between 1937 and 2000, the ESF grew to represent about $374 billion 
  in wages, which included approximately 236 million wage items with an invalid 
  name and SSN combination. As of July 2002, SSA had posted 9.6 million wage items 
  to the ESF for Tax Year 2000, representing about $49 billion in wages. <br>
  <br>
  While SSA has limited control over factors causing the volume of erroneous wage 
  reports submitted each year, there are still areas where SSA can improve its 
  processes. Prior accomplishments may be enhanced by continuing to educate employers 
  on reporting criteria, identify and correct employer reporting problems, and 
  encourage greater use of the Agency&#8217;s SSN verification programs. SSA also 
  needs to improve coordination with other Federal agencies with separate, yet 
  related, mandates. For example, SSA&#8217;s ability to improve wage reporting 
  is related to the Internal Revenue Service&#8217;s sanctioning of employers 
  for submitting invalid wage data and the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration 
  Services&#8217; procedures used by employers to verify eligible employees. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Social Security Number Integrity 
  Protection Team<br>
  Finally, pending funding, we will be establishing an SSN Integrity Protection 
  Team (Team) to address the escalating issue of SSN misuse. The Team is an integrated 
  approach that combines the talents of our auditors, investigators, computer 
  specialists, analysts, and attorneys. In addition to supporting homeland security 
  initiatives, the Team will focus its efforts on<br>
  <br>
  &#8226; identifying patterns and trends of SSN misuse;<br>
  &#8226; locating systemic weaknesses that contribute to SSN misuse, such as 
  in the enumeration and earnings-related processes;<br>
  &#8226; recommending legislative or other corrective actions to ensure the SSN&#8217;s 
  integrity; and<br>
  &#8226; pursuing criminal and civil enforcement provisions for individuals misusing 
  SSNs. <br>
  <br>
  This Team will also partner with external private and public sector organizations 
  not only to educate, but to pursue mutually beneficial activities to prevent 
  and detect fraudulent use of SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  In FY 2004, we plan to complete 16 reviews and begin 13 reviews in this area.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ENUMERATION OF CHILDREN 
  UNDER AGE 1<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the extent to which SSA has assigned SSNs to children under age 
  1 based on fraudulent birth certificates.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Based on prior audit work, we identified the assignment of SSNs to children 
  as an area prone to fraud. Despite training and guidance provided to SSA field 
  office (FO) personnel, the quality of many counterfeit documents is often too 
  professional to detect by visual inspection. Last year, SSA revised its policies 
  and procedures to require that FO personnel obtain independent verification 
  of the birth records for U.S.-born individuals age 1 and older from State or 
  local Bureaus of Vital Statistics before issuing an SSN card. However, SSA does 
  not require verification of birth certificates for children under age 1 before 
  SSN assignment and continues to only require a visual inspection.<br>
  <br>
  Recent investigations have shown that SSA is vulnerable to individuals who present 
  fraudulent birth certificates when attempting to obtain an SSN card for children 
  under age 1. By posing as parents of newborns, individuals used counterfeit 
  birth certificates and baptismal certificates to obtain SSN cards at FOs and 
  through the mail. Applicants often presented birth certificates from States 
  other than the State in which they were applying for the SSNs. We believe a 
  contributing factor in these individuals&#8217; success in obtaining SSNs is 
  that FO personnel are less familiar with the appearance of birth certificates 
  from States other than their own. <br>
  <br>
  As part of our review, we will analyze a nation-wide statistical sample of original 
  SSNs assigned at FOs to children under age 1. We will verify the authenticity 
  of the birth certificates presented by the parents with the appropriate State 
  Bureau of Vital Statistics. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">FLORIDA UNIVERSITIES&#8217; 
  ISSUANCE OF &#8220;TEMPORARY&#8221; SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS TO FOREIGN STUDENTS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate Florida universities&#8217; policies and practices for issuing &#8220;temporary&#8221; 
  SSNs to foreign students.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Thousands of foreign students enroll in educational institutions in Florida 
  each year. Some educational institutions enroll large numbers of foreign students 
  and endeavor to assimilate these students into American society as soon as possible. 
  To assist in this process, some universities issue &#8220;temporary&#8221; SSNs 
  to foreign students until they receive a permanent SSN. Students are responsible 
  for applying for an SSN and replacing the temporary number. University employees 
  stated they issue temporary SSNs for short periods so students can begin working, 
  open bank accounts, and obtain drivers licenses.<br>
  <br>
  We do not know how widespread this practice is or how long it has been in place. 
  Universities may have implemented this practice in part to circumvent SSA&#8217;s 
  nonwork restrictions or to assist foreign students who were experiencing delays 
  in obtaining an SSN from SSA. Whatever the reason for this practice, universities 
  could potentially be violating section 205 (c)(2) of the Social Security Act, 
  which clearly specifies that only SSA may issue SSNs. <br>
  <br>
  We will determine the extent to which Florida universities have issued temporary 
  SSNs, whether the universities provided guidance to foreign students regarding 
  the potential use of these numbers, and how foreign students are actually using 
  these numbers (for example, to open bank accounts, obtain drivers licenses, 
  or gain employment). In addition, we will determine whether the universities 
  can cite any source granting them the authority to issue temporary SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW UP OF THE EMPLOYERS WITH THE MOST SUSPENDED WAGE ITEMS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To (1) assess actions SSA has taken in response to our September 1999 report, 
  Patterns of Reporting Errors and Irregularities by 100 Employers with the Most 
  Suspended Wage Items (A 03-98-31009), and (2) determine whether the wage reporting 
  accuracy of these earlier top 100 employers has improved.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Our September 1999 report, Patterns of Reporting Errors and Irregularities by 
  100 Employers with the Most Suspended Wage Items (A-03-98-31009), identified 
  the 100 employers with the most suspended wage items in Tax Years 1993 to 1996. 
  The 100 employers with the most suspended Forms W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, 
  from 1993 through 1996 accounted for about 1.2 million suspended wage items, 
  5.4 percent of the 22 million suspense items during the period. Further, they 
  accounted for about $1.8 billion in suspended wages in 1995 and 1996, about 
  4 percent of the $42.9 billion in suspended wages for the period. Many of these 
  employers&#8217; suspended wage items exhibited patterns of reporting errors 
  and irregularities that we believe warrant follow up by SSA.<br>
  <br>
  Specifically, we recommended that SSA: <br>
  &#8226; Develop and implement a corrective action plan for the 100 employers 
  and continue efforts to contact those employers responsible for large numbers 
  of suspended wage items. <br>
  <br>
  &#8226; Establish preventive controls to detect wage reporting errors and irregularities.<br>
  <br>
  &#8226; Identify those employers who continually submit annual wage reports 
  with large numbers and/or percentages of unassigned, identical, and/or consecutively 
  numbered SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  &#8226; Run address standardization software as soon as practical after employers 
  submit their annual wage reports to identify employers who report the same address 
  for many employees.<br>
  <br>
  Our review will assess SSA&#8217;s implementation of the recommendations made 
  in the 1999 report as well as other actions related to employers with suspended 
  earnings. In addition, we will review the wage reporting accuracy of these earlier 
  top 100 employers for wages submitted during Tax Years 1997 through 2000. <br>
  <br>
  IMPACT OF UNAUTHORIZED EMPLOYMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the accuracy of SSA&#8217;s Non-Work Alien (NWALIEN) file and estimate 
  benefit amounts resulting from unauthorized employment.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Each year, SSA notifies the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s Bureau of 
  Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS) of noncitizens who have earnings 
  recorded under an SSN assigned for non-work purposes. This notification is sent 
  to BCIS in the form of an electronic data file called the NWALIEN file.<br>
  <br>
  While SSA notifies BCIS of unauthorized employment, BCIS does not notify SSA 
  when it changes a person&#8217;s employment status from unauthorized to authorized. 
  Unless the person personally informs SSA of such a change, SSA enumeration records 
  continue to show the individual as unauthorized for employment, and SSA will 
  include his or her earnings on the NWALIEN file.<br>
  <br>
  To provide SSA with a more accurate estimate of legitimate non-work records 
  on the NWALIEN file and the amount of benefits potentially payable for unauthorized 
  employment, we plan to sample the NWALIEN file and verify current non-work status 
  with BCIS. Once employment status is known, we will use the non-work sample 
  cases to estimate future benefits. <br>
  <br>
  INTERNAL CONTROL REVIEW OF THE PROCESSING OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER CARDS<br>
  Planned Start<br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the adequacy of internal controls over the processing of SSN cards 
  at the National Computer Center.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSN cards are issued daily. Approximately 18 million cards are issued to recipients 
  each year. Because SSNs are necessary to obtain employment and Social Security 
  benefits, the SSN card is printed with a number of security features to prevent 
  the card from being fraudulently duplicated. <br>
  <br>
  To minimize the risk of theft or misuse of the SSN cards, strong internal controls 
  are needed to monitor the processing of the cards during the normal day-to-day 
  operations. We will review the receipt of card stock, printing of SSN cards, 
  and the distribution of the cards. Our review will determine whether the internal 
  controls in place provide reasonable assurance that SSN cards are adequately 
  safeguarded.<br>
  <br>
  MILITARY WAGE ITEMS IN THE EARNINGS SUSPENSE FILE<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether individuals having public responsibilities and positions 
  of trust, primarily active duty military employees, have wages posted to SSA&#8217;s 
  Earnings Suspense File (ESF).<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title II of the Social Security Act requires that SSA maintain records of wage 
  amounts employers pay individuals. Employers report their employees&#8217; wages 
  to SSA at the conclusion of each tax year. Wages on those employer reports containing 
  invalid names and/or SSNs cannot be posted to an individual&#8217;s earnings 
  record in SSA&#8217;s Master Earnings File. Instead, these wages are placed 
  in the ESF&#8212;a repository for unmatched wages. Suspended wages can affect 
  a worker&#8217;s eligibility for and/or the amount of retirement, disability, 
  or survivor benefits. <br>
  <br>
  In a recent audit of nonwork SSNs, we found that individuals having public responsibilities 
  and positions of trust, primarily Federal and active duty military employees, 
  had wages in SSA&#8217;s unauthorized employment file. Our proposed review would 
  determine whether a similar condition exists for such employees where SSA could 
  not match the name and/or SSN on the wage report to Agency records and had to 
  place the wages in the ESF.<br>
  <br>
  A preliminary review of the ESF indicates that military branches are still submitting 
  items to the ESF. Just as we are concerned about individuals not authorized 
  to work, we are concerned about unknown individuals working for the military. 
  These may be simple reporting errors, and not all contain wages, but they do 
  represent a known problem reported to SSA.<br>
  <br>
  REPORTED EARNINGS BEFORE THE ISSUANCE OF A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine why numberholders are showing earnings on their earnings records 
  before they are enumerated by SSA. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA provides Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance benefits to individuals 
  based on their lifetime earnings reported under a valid SSN. These earnings 
  determine whether an individual has enough quarters of coverage, or work credits, 
  for insured status. Social Security work credits are based on an individual's 
  total annual wages or self-employment income. An individual can earn up to four 
  credits each year. The amount needed for a credit changes from year to year. 
  In 2002, for example, an individual earned one credit for each $870 of wages 
  or self-employment income. When an individual earns $3,480, he or she has earned 
  four credits for the year.<br>
  <br>
  Our March 2003 Congressional Response Report, Social Security Administration 
  Benefits Related to Unauthorized Work (A-03-03-23053), noted that Social Security 
  laws and regulations only sometimes differentiate between citizens and noncitizens 
  for the purpose of determining quarters of coverage. As a result, in many cases, 
  SSA creates a work history for individuals with valid SSNs, even when some of 
  the earnings belonged to noncitizens who were in the United States illegally 
  or were otherwise unauthorized to work at the time of their earnings but who 
  later obtained valid SSNs. <br>
  <br>
  In cases where earnings before enumeration have occurred in SSA&#8217;s systems, 
  the individuals in question could have been working in the economy in violation 
  of immigration laws. It is also possible these cases represent other problems, 
  such as improper postings by SSA or errors in SSA&#8217;s Numident. <br>
  <br>
  As part of our review, we will extract earnings records from SSA&#8217;s systems 
  showing earnings before enumeration and review a sample of these records to 
  determine the frequency of such occurrences, their causes, and their potential 
  impact on the integrity of SSA's programs. Our assessment will also note any 
  situations that may relate to SSN misuse and/or a violation of immigration laws.<br>
  <br>
  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER CARDS ISSUED AFTER DEATH<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA&#8217;s controls over the issuance of replacement SSN cards where 
  the Numident contains a date of death.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Individuals applying for a replacement SSN card must complete, sign, and submit 
  an Application for a Social Security Card (Form SS-5) at an SSA field office 
  or through the mail. Because SSA must be certain the individual is who he or 
  she claims to be, SSA requires that each applicant present documentary evidence 
  of his or her identity. An identity document submitted as evidence must be recently 
  issued and provide information so field office personnel can compare its contents 
  with SS-5 data and/or with the applicant&#8217;s physical appearance. <br>
  <br>
  Field office personnel review the SS-5 and determine the validity of supporting 
  evidentiary documents. Staff then certifies and enters applicant information 
  into SSA&#8217;s Modernized Enumeration System. Once certified, the SSN application 
  undergoes numerous automated edits to further validate applicant information. 
  If the application passes all of these edits, the Modernized Enumeration System 
  issues a replacement SSN card.<br>
  <br>
  SSA will not issue a replacement card when the numberholder is deceased. Rather, 
  the Agency can provide verification, such as third-party verification, an SSN 
  verification printout, or instructions on how to obtain a Numident. The requestor 
  must provide proper identification and the death certificate, if the death is 
  not posted on the Numident. <br>
  <br>
  Recent audit work has found numerous instances where it appears multiple SSN 
  replacement cards were issued to individuals after a date of death had been 
  posted to the Numident. The review will determine whether the appropriate policy 
  is being followed and identify instances of potential SSN misuse. <br>
  <br>
  SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WITH MORE THAN ONE OWNER<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine how often SSA&#8217;s records show that more than one individual 
  has been provided the same SSN.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  One of the key elements SSA employs in administering the Nation&#8217;s Social 
  Security system is the SSN. SSA uses a unique SSN to distinguish each individual&#8217;s 
  record of earnings from all others and stores these SSNs, as well as the associated 
  numberholder&#8217;s information, on a master file called the Numident. Protecting 
  the SSN&#8217;s integrity is essential to the proper posting of earnings, the 
  payment of benefits, and the prevention of SSN misuse. <br>
  <br>
  In our August 2002 report, Effectiveness of the Social Security Administration&#8217;s 
  Earnings After Death Process (A-03-01-11035), we reported on two Numident records 
  where more than one person appeared to share the same SSN. At the time, we referred 
  these cases to SSA for resolution and were told that such errors can occur when 
  identifying information for one person is erroneously posted to the Numident 
  record of another. For example, a replacement card could be issued to an individual 
  in error from someone else&#8217;s Numident record.<br>
  <br>
  Our review will determine whether SSA&#8217;s Numident contains additional records 
  where more than one person was given the same SSN. Specifically, we will review 
  a sample of Numident records where key elements related to the SSN owner appear 
  to be in dispute and may represent more than one person on the record. We will 
  also assess the resolution of the earlier Numident errors noted in our August 
  2002 report. Furthermore, if we do identify instances where individuals are 
  sharing the same SSN, we will determine (1) whether wages reported by these 
  individuals were properly posted and (2) the impact any posting errors might 
  have on the receipt and amount of Social Security benefits. <br>

  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S BROOKLYN SOCIAL SECURITY CARD CENTER<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To (1) evaluate the Brooklyn SSN Card Center's compliance with policies and 
  procedures for enumerating noncitizens and (2) assess the Center's effectiveness 
  in meeting its mission.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Since September 11, 2001, SSA has made several changes in the verification of 
  documents needed to obtain an SSN. Concerns about national security, along with 
  the growing problem of identity theft, have caused SSA to take steps to protect 
  the integrity of the SSN. Specifically, effective July 15, 2002 and phased in 
  through September 2002, SSA began requiring that all field offices obtain confirmation 
  of all Immigration and Naturalization Service (now the Department of Homeland 
  Security) documents that did not verify through the Systematic Alien Verification 
  for Entitlement (SAVE) program. Among other requirements, SSA also instructed 
  field offices to list the I-94 admission number and status code or the alien 
  registration number (&#8220;A&#8221; number) on the SSN application along with 
  the 15-digit SAVE number. <br>
  <br>
  As part of its efforts to enhance public service and strengthen the SSN&#8217;s 
  integrity, SSA opened the Brooklyn SSN Card Center in November 2002. The Center's 
  purpose is to improve the document authentication process, deter and detect 
  SSN fraud, and assist in identifying trends and suspicious activities.<br>

  <br>
  Recent SSA pilot studies have shown that field office personnel are not always 
  following these new procedures. We will analyze a statistical sample of original 
  SSNs issued to noncitizens to determine, on a nation-wide level, the extent 
  of field office compliance with SSA&#8217;s enumeration policies and procedures.</font></p>

  COMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR ENUMERATING NONCITIZENS AT OVERSEAS 
  POSTS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate SSA's compliance with policies and procedures for enumerating noncitizens 
  through Foreign Service Posts and the Office of International Operations.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Since September 11, 2001, SSA has made several changes in the verification of 
  documents needed to obtain an SSN. Concerns about national security, along with 
  the growing problem of identity theft, have caused SSA to take steps to protect 
  the integrity of the SSN. Specifically, effective July 15, 2002 and phased in 
  through September 2002, SSA began requiring that all field offices (FO) obtain 
  confirmation of all Immigration and Naturalization Service (now the Department 
  of Homeland Security) documents that did not verify through the Systematic Alien 
  Verification for Entitlement (SAVE) program. Among other requirements, SSA also 
  instructed FOs to list the I-94 admission number and status code or the alien 
  registration number (&#8220;A&#8221; number) on the SSN application along with 
  the 15-digit SAVE number. <br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, since individuals residing overseas can obtain SSNs with the assistance 
  of SSA's Office of International Operations and its representatives at Foreign 
  Service Posts, these locations are also required to take additional verification 
  steps when reviewing Department of Homeland Security documents. <br>
  <br>
  Given the tragic events of September 11, SSA must ensure the integrity of its 
  enumeration process in all locations, including overseas. OIG has never reviewed 
  SSA&#8217;s procedures for enumerating noncitizens through Foreign Service Posts 
  or the Office of International Operations.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S INTERNAL USE OF EMPLOYEE SOCIAL SECURITY 
  NUMBERS<br>
  Planned Start<br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the extent of SSA&#8217;s internal use of employees&#8217; SSNs 
  and evaluate the safeguards used within the Agency to protect the confidentiality 
  of these SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The SSN was created in 1936 as a means of tracking workers' earnings and eligibility 
  for Social Security benefits. Nevertheless, over the years, the SSN has become 
  a de facto national identifier used by Federal agencies, State and local governments, 
  and private organizations. The expanded use of the SSN as a national identifier 
  provides a tempting motive for many unscrupulous individuals to acquire an SSN 
  and use it for illegal purposes.<br>
  <br>
  Federal agencies frequently ask individuals for their SSNs because, in certain 
  instances, the law requires that they do so, or SSNs provide a convenient means 
  of tracking and exchanging information. While a number of laws and regulations 
  require the use of SSNs for various Federal programs, they generally also impose 
  limitations on how those SSNs may be used. Although no single Federal law regulates 
  overall use and disclosure of SSNs by Federal agencies, the Freedom of Information 
  Act of 1966, the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Social Security Act Amendments 
  of 1990 generally govern the disclosure and use of SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  Federal agencies have a responsibility to limit the risk of unauthorized disclosure 
  of SSNs. SSA is responsible for issuing SSNs and maintaining earnings records 
  for millions of SSN holders. Therefore, we believe SSA should take a leadership 
  role to help prevent the use and disclosure of SSNs, including those of its 
  employees.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S PROCEDURES FOR ENUMERATING FOREIGN 
  STUDENTS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To (1) evaluate SSA&#8217;s policies and procedures for enumerating foreign 
  students and (2) review the polices and practices of educational institutions, 
  the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), and the Department 
  of State as they impact the integrity of SSA&#8217;s process for enumerating 
  foreign students.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Given today&#8217;s heightened threat of terrorism, failure to protect the SSN&#8217;s 
  integrity can have enormous consequences for our Nation and its citizens. Now 
  more than ever, SSA must be particularly cautious in striking a balance between 
  serving the public and maintaining SSN integrity. We recognize that increased 
  measures will impact the time necessary to process SSN applications. However, 
  given the large number of foreign students who enroll in U.S. universities each 
  year, we believe SSA must employ effective front-end controls in its enumeration 
  process.<br>
  <br>
  Over 500,000 foreign students enrolled at educational institutions in the United 
  States during the 2001-2002 academic year. Students coming to the United States 
  to pursue full-time academic or vocational studies are admitted under three 
  nonimmigrant visa categories: (1) the F-1 visa, which includes academic students 
  in colleges, universities, seminaries, conservatories, academic high schools, 
  other academic institutions and language training; (2) the M-1 visa, which relates 
  only to vocational students; and (3) the J-1 visa, which covers exchange visitors. 
  These three categories account for approximately 1 million of the 32.8 million 
  nonimmigrant visas issued in FY 2001, or about 3 percent of the nonimmigrant 
  visas issued. Foreign students attending a U.S. university would normally enter 
  the country with F-1 or J-1 visas.<br>
  <br>
  Students with F 1 visas have the authority to work on-campus when they meet 
  certain criteria. BCIS requires that the school ensure the F 1 student is attending 
  school full time and is in good academic standing. In terms of work requirements, 
  F 1 students may be employed on campus at the institution where they are enrolled. 
  In determining whether to issue an SSN, SSA field office personnel determine 
  the eligibility for enumeration of the F 1 foreign students by third party documentation 
  from the school or the on-campus employer. For example, a foreign student may 
  present a letter from his/her advisor stating the student is authorized to work 
  on-campus. Students with J 1 visas are required to provide SSA with a Form DS 
  2019, Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status, indicating 
  their authorization to work in the United States and an employment letter from 
  their sponsor.<br>
  <br>
  TITLE II BENEFICIARIES WITH MILITARY EARNINGS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To provide updated information concerning the status of SSA&#8217;s efforts 
  to determine whether military wage credits are properly included when calculating 
  benefits for veterans.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Before 1957, when military wages became subject to Social Security taxes and 
  were credited toward Social Security benefits, members of the military faced 
  reduced Social Security benefits as a result of their service. Even after military 
  service became covered under Social Security, their historically low wages still 
  resulted in relatively small Social Security benefits. To improve retirement 
  security for members of the armed forces, Congress granted wage credits for 
  certain service from 1940 to 2001 to boost Social Security benefits.<br>
  <br>
  A letter from the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security, House Committee 
  on Ways and Means, asked that we investigate and determine the <br>
  <br>
  1. status of ongoing efforts in SSA to ensure members of the military and their 
  families receive proper accounting of their military wage credits toward benefits; 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. estimated number of members of the military and their eligible family members
  who may be affected by failure to properly use military wage credits as well
  as the potential impact on their benefits; and </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. potential amount of under- and overpaid benefits related to inappropriate
  application of military wage credits.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will determine (1) the
    number of military veterans receiving SSA benefits, (2) the complexities
    of the legal and regulatory environment,
    (3) potential
  SSA systems limitations that need to be considered in correcting under- overpayments,
  (4) the status of any open OIG recommendations from previous audits in this
  area, and (5) SSA&#8217;s planned approach to resolve any under- overpayments.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> UTILITY OF EARNINGS WAGE 
  RECORDS IN THE EARNINGS SUSPENSE FILE<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine how older reinstated wages impact individuals&#8217; earnings records 
  and the amount of benefits paid to them.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title II of the Social Security Act requires that SSA maintain records of wage 
  amounts employers pay to individuals. Employers report their employees&#8217; 
  wages to SSA at the conclusion of each tax year. Wages on those employer reports 
  containing invalid names and/or SSNs cannot be posted to an individual&#8217;s 
  earnings record in SSA&#8217;s Master Earnings File. Instead, these wages are 
  placed in the Earnings Suspense File (ESF)&#8212;a repository for unmatched 
  wages. Suspended wages can affect a worker&#8217;s eligibility for and/or the 
  amount of retirement, disability, or survivor benefits. Suspended wages can 
  be reinstated from the ESF when they are matched to the correct individual. 
  SSA reinstates these wages through both automated and manual processes. <br>
  <br>
  In a prior report, we commented on a study conducted by an SSA contractor to 
  reduce the size and growth of the ESF. The contractor considered various criteria 
  and alternatives for reducing the size of the ESF, including removing wage items 
  several years old to keeping all suspense file records. Our report noted that 
  the earnings data used in the contractor study could have been expanded to provide 
  SSA a better understanding of the risks related to record removal. We recommended 
  that SSA conduct further analysis to ensure any data maintained in the ESF will 
  make a difference in earnings accuracy in terms of eligibility and/or benefit 
  amount for the wage earner. We also noted that SSA could safely implement a 
  number of the removal options offered by the contractor, including removing 
  items in the ESF that were 43-years-old or older. This report is intended to 
  assist SSA with this analysis.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Management of the Disability 
  Process<br>
  SSA has tested several improvements to the disability claims process. To date, 
  these initiatives have shown some progress in making improvement. In January 
  2003, GAO added the modernizing of Federal disability programs, including SSA&#8217;s, 
  to its high-risk list.<br>
  <br>
  SSA administers the Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income 
  (SSI) programs that provide benefits based on disability. Most disability claims 
  are initially processed through a network of Social Security field offices and 
  State Disability Determination Services (DDS). SSA representatives in the field 
  offices are responsible for obtaining applications for disability benefits and 
  verifying non-medical eligibility requirements, which may include age, employment, 
  marital status, or Social Security coverage information. After initial processing, 
  the field office sends the case to a DDS for evaluation of disability. <br>
  <br>
  The DDSs, which SSA fully funds, are State agencies responsible for developing 
  medical evidence and rendering the determination of whether the claimant is 
  disabled or blind. After the DDS makes the disability determination, it returns 
  the case to the field office for appropriate action depending on whether the 
  claim is allowed or denied. In FY 2003, over 2.5 million initial disability 
  claims were processed, and the average processing time was 97.1 days.<br>
  <br>
  Once SSA establishes an individual is eligible for disability benefits under 
  either the DI or SSI program, the Agency turns its efforts toward ensuring the 
  individual continues to receive benefits only as long as SSA&#8217;s eligibility 
  criteria are met. Disability benefits will not continue if any of the following 
  occur:<br>
  <br>
  &#8226; a continuing disability review shows the individual is no longer disabled. 
  <br>
  &#8226; an individual returns to work and has income over SSA&#8217;s allowable 
  amount, <br>
  &#8226; a child turns age 18 and is not considered disabled under adult criteria, 
  or<br>
  &#8226; legislation or Federal regulations rescind a prior disabling condition 
  from qualifying for benefits.<br>
  <br>
  SSA&#8217;s Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) is responsible for holding 
  hearings and issuing decisions in SSA&#8217;s appeals process. OHA&#8217;s field 
  structure consists of 10 regional offices and 140 hearing offices. Administrative 
  law judges (ALJ) hold hearings and issue decisions in hearing offices nationwide. 
  In FY 2003, hearing offices processed over 570,000 cases, and the average processing 
  time was 344 days.<br>
  <br>
  The Appeals Council is the final level of administrative review for claims filed 
  under SSA&#8217;s disability programs. The Appeals Council reviews ALJ decisions 
  and dismissals upon the claimant&#8217;s timely request for review. In FY 2003, 
  the Appeals Council processed 100,750 cases, and the average processing time 
  was 294 days.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the last several years, 
  SSA has tested improvements to the disability claims process as a result of 
  concerns about the timeliness and quality of customer service. The disability 
  improvements combine initiatives that have been tested and piloted and include 
  all levels of eligibility determination&#8212;beginning with State DDSs and 
  going through the hearings and appeals processes. <br>
  <br>
  To date, these initiatives have shown some progress in making improvements in 
  the disability claims process. Still, in January 2003, GAO added the modernizing 
  of Federal disability programs, including SSA&#8217;s, to its 2003 high-risk 
  list. The Commissioner recently announced several decisions on the future of 
  SSA&#8217;s disability process. This included the Commissioner&#8217;s decisions 
  to <br>
  <br>
  &#8226; pursue the expansion of the Single-Decision Maker authority nationwide, 
  <br>
  &#8226; end the requirements for the claimant conference in sites testing the 
  prototype disability process, <br>
  &#8226; evaluate the elimination of the reconsideration level of the claims 
  process nationwide, <br>
  &#8226; make additional improvements to the hearings process, and <br>
  &#8226; implement an Electronic Disability System by 2004. <br>
  <br>
  SSA reports that its short-term initiatives have improved the hearings process. 
  The short-term initiatives include expedited techniques for the review of cases 
  and technology enhancements designed to improve the timeliness of decisions. 
  Furthermore, SSA expects the electronic disability system to provide OHA a more 
  efficient and effective case processing system when implemented. In September 
  2003, the Commissioner announced long-term initiatives to address the Agency&#8217;s 
  disability-related challenges, which she stated are predicated on the successful 
  implementation of the Electronic Disability System.<br>
  <br>
  Disability Fraud <br>
  Fraud is an inherent risk in SSA&#8217;s disability programs. Some unscrupulous 
  people view SSA&#8217;s disability benefits as money waiting to be taken. A 
  key risk factor in the disability program is individuals who feign or exaggerate 
  symptoms to become eligible for disability benefits. Another key risk factor 
  is the monitoring of medical improvements for disabled individuals to ensure 
  those individuals who are no longer disabled are removed from the disability 
  rolls. <br>
  <br>
  SSA, in conjunction with our office, has taken an active role in addressing 
  the integrity of the disability programs through the Cooperative Disability 
  Investigations (CDI) program. The CDI program&#8217;s mission is to obtain evidence 
  that can resolve questions of fraud in SSA&#8217;s disability programs. SSA&#8217;s 
  Offices of Operations, Disability Programs, and Disability Determinations along 
  with the OIG manage the CDI program. There are 18 CDI units operating in 17 
  States. In FY 2003, the CDI units saved SSA approximately $100 million by identifying 
  fraud and or similar fault in initial and continuing claims in SSA&#8217;s disability 
  programs.<br>
  <br>
  In FY 2004, we plan to complete nine reviews and begin five reviews in this 
  area.</font></p>

  IMPROVEMENT ACTION PLAN<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the effectiveness of the short-term initiatives of the Appeals Council 
  Process Improvement (ACPI) Action Plan.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Office of Hearings and Appeals Appeals Council provides the final level 
  of administrative review for claims. The Council reviews hearing decisions and 
  dismissals at a claimant&#8217;s request. The Council receives approximately 
  85,000 requests for review each year. The processing times for cases has increased 
  from 141 days in 1995 to 505 days in 2000. The pending requests increased from 
  47,000 in 1995 to 128,000 in 2000. In March 2000, SSA established the ACPI Action 
  Plan to improve the quality of service to claimants seeking requests for review 
  by the Appeals Council. The goal was to reduce the processing time for requests 
  for review cases to 90 days by the end of 2003. In addition, ACPI would reduce 
  the pending request workload to 16,224 by the end of 2003.<br>
  <br>
  The Plan contains both short-term process innovations and long-term structural 
  improvements. The short-term initiatives include increasing productivity of 
  existing staff, adding resources to increase capacity, and adjusting incoming 
  workloads. These initiatives began at various times in 2000 and were scheduled 
  to end in 2001. Specific short term actions include hiring 30 staff, the Office 
  of General Counsel providing 25 workyears of staff time, emphasis on aged requests, 
  managers processing appeals, and using retired administrative law judges to 
  review cases.<br>
  <br>
  COMPARISON OF SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION CODES AMONG SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 
  DATABASES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether disabled individuals receiving concurrent benefits have 
  been suspended or terminated in one SSA program while continuing to receive 
  benefits under another SSA program.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Disabled individuals can qualify for disability benefits under both the Disability 
  Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs. Such individuals, known 
  as concurrent beneficiaries, can continue to receive benefits for as long as 
  they meet the eligibility requirements under both programs. <br>
  <br>
  However, certain events, such as the cessation of disability, will have the 
  effect of suspending and/or terminating payments under both programs. By reviewing 
  suspension and termination codes in both the Master Beneficiary Record and Supplemental 
  Security Record databases and investigating whether these codes are consistently 
  used for the concurrent beneficiaries, we plan to isolate any individuals suspended 
  or terminated in only one of SSA&#8217;s disability programs.<br>
  <br>
  DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES&#8217; CLAIMS PROCESSING PERFORMANCE<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify potential factors and practices at State Disability Determination 
  Services (DDS) that result in differing levels of performance in the disability 
  claims processing areas of production, timeliness, accuracy and cost.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In accordance with Federal regulations, each State&#8217;s DDS makes medical 
  determinations of disability for SSA&#8217;s Disability Insurance and Supplemental 
  Security Income programs. SSA pays 100 percent of the allowable costs incurred 
  by DDSs in making disability determinations. Each State is responsible for establishing 
  the DDS organizational structure; providing qualified management, personnel, 
  medical consultant services, adequate facilities, and a quality assurance function; 
  and maintaining regulatory performance levels and a performance monitoring system. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Performance statistics for FY 2002 initial claims vary widely among the 54 DDSs. 
  Performance statistics show DDS <br>
  1. processing times ranging from a low of 64 days to a high of 129 days for 
  Title II claims and from a low of 69 to a high of 134 days for Title XVI claims,<br>
  2. allowance rates ranging from a low of 26 percent to a high of 59 percent, 
  and <br>
  3. consultative examination purchase rates ranging from a low of 24 percent 
  to a high of 77 percent.<br>
  <br>
  OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS PERFORMANCE TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify potential factors and practices at hearing offices that result in 
  differing levels of performance in the areas of productivity and timeliness.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Office of Hearings and Appeals administers the hearings and appeals program 
  for SSA. The hearing process begins after an applicant for benefits has been 
  denied at the initial and reconsideration levels. The next step in the appeals 
  process is a hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). The request for 
  hearing is most likely to involve the issue of disability&#8212;Disability Insurance 
  or Supplemental Security Income or both. Medicare and retirement or survivor 
  issues comprise less than 10 percent of the cases ALJs decide.<br>
  <br>
  The Chief ALJ is the principal consultant and advisor to the Associate Commissioner 
  on all matters concerning the ALJ hearing process and all field operations. 
  The Chief ALJ manages and administers the hearing organization consisting of 
  10 regional offices and 140 hearing offices. Approximatley 1,000 ALJs enter 
  over 500,000 decisions at the hearing level annually.<br>
  <br>
  OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS PRE-EFFECTUATION REVIEW PROCESS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To (1) review decisions made by the Office of Quality Assurance and Performance 
  Assessment (OQA), the Appeals Council, and administrative law judges (ALJ) as 
  part of the pre-effectuation review (PER) process and (2) determine the reasons 
  for, and effects of, divergent decisions made by these parties.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  As part of its continuing efforts to improve the quality of its disability determinations, 
  SSA has modified the review process involving disability allowance decisions 
  made by ALJs. In August 1998, the Agency began the PER process of ALJ decisions. 
  This process allows OQA to review allowance decisions made by ALJs and refer 
  them to the Appeals Council for review. PERs focus on cases that involve problematic 
  issues or have a higher likelihood of error. Once referred, the Appeals Council 
  considers the case and OQA&#8217;s reasons for believing the decision should 
  be reviewed. The Appeals Council has 60 days to look at those cases it decides 
  to review. After its review, it can issue its own decision on the case or remand 
  the case back to the ALJ who initially decided to allow the case for further 
  review and a final disability determination. <br>
  <br>
  SSA initiated the PER process to identify policy issues that should be clarified 
  through publication of regulations or rulings. Initial discussions with SSA 
  staff indicate the PER process has identified differences in disability determinations 
  between OQA policy and the ALJ&#8217;s decisions. Through the PER process, OQA 
  has identified cases that were initially allowed by the ALJ, but that OQA feels 
  should be disallowed. Further, after referral from OQA, the Appeals Council 
  often agrees with OQA&#8217;s position and remands such cases back to the ALJs 
  for further review.<br>

  SUMMARY REPORT OF SINGLE AUDIT OVERSIGHT ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  2nd Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To summarize internal control weaknesses at State Disability Determination Services 
  (DDS) reported in State single audits and identified during the OIG single audit 
  oversight activities.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  On July 5, 1996, the President signed the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, 
  which extended the statutory audit requirement to nonprofit organizations and 
  revised various provisions of the 1984 Act including raising the Federal financial 
  assistance dollar threshold from $100,000 to $300,000. On June 30, 1997, the 
  Office of Management and Budget issued revised Circular A-133, Audits of States, 
  Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations, to implement the 1996 amendments 
  and rescinded Circular A-128.<br>
  <br>
  There are 54 DDSs located in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto 
  Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. All DDSs are subject to the Single Audit 
  Act except for the federally administered Virgin Islands DDS.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S ABILITY TO OFFSET SPECIAL DISABILITY 
  WORKLOAD UNDERPAYMENTS<br>
  Planned Start<br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To quantify the amount of Special Disability Workload (SDW) related underpayments 
  that can be offset against overpayments for the same beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA has identified a group of individuals who are receiving Supplemental Security 
  Income (SSI) disability benefits and who appear to be insured for, but are not 
  currently receiving, disability benefits under the Disability Insurance (DI) 
  program. These cases are referred to as the SDW workload. Some of these individuals 
  may have a retroactive period for benefit payments dating back as far as 1973. 
  However, the average retroactive period is 8 years. <br>
  <br>
  SSA provides notice of potential eligibility and the statutory requirement to 
  file for disability benefits under the DI program. However, SSI recipients must 
  apply for DI benefits for which they may be eligible. The recipients do not 
  have an option. In addition, other individuals may apply (auxiliary applications) 
  for benefits under the DI program.<br>
  <br>
  SDW cases may involve lengthy retroactive periods and could result in substantial 
  retroactive DI program benefit payments. These benefit payments may be considered 
  &#8220;underpayments&#8221; to beneficiaries.</font></p>

  OVERSIGHT OF INDIRECT COSTS CLAIMED BY STATE DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA&#8217;s oversight of indirect costs claimed by State Disability 
  Determination Services (DDS).<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA reimburses State DDSs for 100 percent of allowable expenditures incurred 
  in making disability determinations under SSA&#8217;s Disability Insurance and 
  Supplemental Security Income programs. The expenditures include both direct 
  and indirect costs. Indirect costs arise from activities that benefit multiple 
  State and Federal agencies but are not readily assignable to any one agency. 
  Examples of indirect costs include services, such as accounting, auditing, budgeting, 
  and payroll. <br>
  <br>
  In accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87, Cost Principles 
  for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments, indirect costs can be allocated 
  to SSA based on the terms of either a negotiated indirect cost rate or through 
  a cost allocation plan. In FY 2002, SSA reimbursed DDSs about $109 million for 
  indirect costs.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S TICKET TO WORK PROGRAM<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To conduct a performance review of SSA and its contractor to ensure contract 
  objectives are being met and are in accordance with the Ticket to Work and Work 
  Incentives Improvement Act.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Ticket to Work (TTW) program was established by the 1999 Ticket to Work 
  and Work Incentives Improvement Act. The program provides eligible Disability 
  Insurance and disabled Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries with tickets 
  that can be used to obtain vocational rehabilitation or employment services 
  through Employment Networks. The program is intended to increase access to, 
  and the quality of, rehabilitation and employment services available to disabled 
  beneficiaries. TTW is designed to provide beneficiaries with greater freedom 
  and choice of service providers, create competition among providers to provide 
  high quality services that are responsive to beneficiary needs, and give providers 
  incentives to deliver services in the most efficient and appropriate manner 
  to achieve desired outcomes. <br>
  <br>
  Daily administration of the TTW program is the responsibility of a Program Manager. 
  SSA hired a contractor to perform this role. The contract includes 23 tasks 
  representing the specific contract services for which the contractor&#8217;s 
  Program Manager is responsible. <br>
  We have selected for review the following 10 tasks identified in the contract. 
  The remaining tasks will be reviewed separately. <br>
  Task 1- Contractor Orientation<br>
  Task 2 - Start-Up Plan <br>
  Task 3 - Toll-Free Number <br>
  Task 8 - Ticket Program Training <br>
  Task 9 - Management of Ticket Process <br>
  Task 16 - Monthly Progress Reports <br>
  Task 17 - Annual Report <br>
  Task 20 - Periodic Meetings with SSA Project Officer <br>
  Task 21 - Periodic Special Studies <br>
  Task 22 - Conference Planning<br>
  <br>
  Improper Payments<br>
  Determining and paying accurate and timely program benefits are primary commitments 
  of SSA, along with good stewardship of the trust fund and the General Revenue 
  fund.<br>
  <br>
  SSA is responsible for issuing benefit payments under the Old-Age, Survivors, 
  and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and SSI programs. In FY 2003, SSA issued $483 
  billion in benefit payments to 53.1 million beneficiaries. Considering the volume 
  and amount of payments SSA makes each month, even the slightest error in the 
  overall process can result in millions of dollars in over- or underpayments. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Improper payments are defined as payments that should not have been made or 
  were made for incorrect amounts. Examples of improper payments include inadvertent 
  errors, payments for unsupported or inadequately supported claims, payments 
  for services not rendered, or payments to ineligible beneficiaries. The risk 
  of improper payments increases in programs with (1) a significant volume of 
  transactions, (2) complex criteria for computing payments, and/or (3) an overemphasis 
  on expediting payments. Since SSA is responsible for issuing timely benefit 
  payments for complex entitlement programs to over 50 million individuals, SSA 
  is at-risk of making significant improper payments. <br>
  <br>
  The President and Congress have expressed interest in measuring the universe 
  of improper payments within the Government. Specifically, in August 2001, OMB 
  published the FY 2002 President's Management Agenda, which included a Government-wide 
  initiative for improving financial performance. In November 2002, the Improper 
  Payments Information Act of 2002 was enacted, and OMB issued guidance in May 
  2003 on implementing this new law.<br>
  <br>
  Under this law, agencies that administer programs where the risk of erroneous 
  payments is significant must estimate their annual amount of improper payments 
  and report this information in their Performance and Accountability Report for 
  FYs ending on or after September 30, 2004. OMB will use this information while 
  working with the agencies to establish goals for reducing erroneous payments 
  for each program. <br>
  <br>
  SSA and the OIG have had on-going discussions on improper payments&#8212;on 
  such issues as detected vs. undetected improper payments and avoidable overpayments 
  vs. unavoidable overpayments which are outside the Agency&#8217;s control and 
  a &#8220;cost of doing business.&#8221; In August 2003, OMB issued specific 
  guidance to SSA to only include avoidable overpayments in the Agency&#8217;s 
  improper payment estimate because these payments could be reduced through changes 
  in administrative actions. Unavoidable overpayments that result from legal or 
  policy requirements are not to be included in SSA&#8217;s improper payment estimate. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In September 2003, the OIG issued an Issue Paper on improper payments&#8212;where 
  we analyzed overpayments from SSA, other Federal agencies, and private sector 
  disability insurers. Based on this work, we plan to initiate a comprehensive 
  and statistically valid review in FY 2004 to quantify the amount of undetected 
  overpayments in SSA&#8217;s disability programs. Additionally, preliminary results 
  from one of our audits at the end of FY 2003 show significant overpayments related 
  to earnings by disabled beneficiaries went undetected by SSA. This work and 
  other studies&#8212;such as one to assess whether overpayment waivers were appropriate&#8212;will 
  be completed and/or initiated in FY 2004 and beyond to address the issue of 
  improper payments. <br>
  <br>
  SSA has undertaken many projects to identify and improve areas where it could 
  do more to reduce improper payments and/or recover amounts overpaid. Specifically, 
  SSA has been working to improve its ability to prevent over- and underpayments 
  by obtaining beneficiary information from independent sources sooner and/or 
  using technology more effectively. In this regard, SSA has initiated new computer 
  matching agreements, obtained on-line access to wage and income data, and implemented 
  improvements in its debt recovery program. <br>
  <br>
  Working with SSA, we have made great strides in reducing benefit payments to 
  prisoners and SSI payments to fugitive felons, and these efforts continue. However, 
  improper payments, including those to deceased beneficiaries, students, and 
  individuals receiving State workers&#8217; compensation benefits, continue to 
  drain the Social Security trust fund. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2004, we plan to complete 16 reviews and begin 12 reviews in this area.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> DEATH UNDERPAYMENTS WITHOUT 
  AN ASSOCIATED SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA is capturing the SSNs of individuals claiming Title 
  II underpayments after a beneficiary has died to ensure (1) the payment is made 
  to an appropriate party and (2) required information is shared with the Internal 
  Revenue Service (IRS).<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  When a beneficiary dies and an underpayment occurs, a third party can claim 
  the final payment using an SSA-1724, Claim for Amounts Due in the Case of a 
  Deceased Beneficiary. This final SSA payment is generally made to a parent or 
  surviving spouse. However, SSA does not always record on the SSA-1724 the SSN 
  of the third party receiving the payment. The lack of this information increases 
  the risk of inappropriate payments to third parties. In addition, when the SSN 
  is missing, SSA cannot report the payment to the IRS for tax collection purposes. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In May 2002, SSA implemented the Single Payment System (SPS), a national system 
  used to automate attorney fee payments and other Title II payments that cannot 
  be made through the current Title II system. SPS was created to (1) ensure the 
  timeliness of attorney fee payments; (2) stop duplicate and erroneous payments; 
  and (3) document management information. <br>
  <br>
  Our review will determine whether SSA is capturing the SSNs of individuals claiming 
  Title II underpayments on an SSA-1724. Specifically, we will review a sample 
  of Calendar Year 2001 and 2002 death underpayments to determine the potential 
  risk of fraud and the possible under-reporting of taxable income to the IRS. 
  Our review will also determine whether the implementation of SPS has increased 
  the likelihood the SSN is captured during the payment process.<br>
  <br>
  DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFICIARIES WITH EARNINGS REPORTED ON THE MASTER EARNINGS 
  FILE<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA investigated earnings posted to SSA&#8217;s Master 
  Earnings File for Tax Years 1996 through 2000 for individuals who were receiving 
  Disability Insurance benefits.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  An individual is disabled under &sect;223 (d)(1) of the Social Security Act 
  if he or she cannot engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) by reason 
  of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that (1) can be 
  expected to result in death or (2) has lasted (or can be expected to last) for 
  a continuous period of not less than 12 months. <br>
  <br>
  SGA is defined as work activity that involves significant physical or mental 
  activities performed for pay or profit. SSA has established earnings guidelines 
  as a basis for determining whether an individual is engaged in SGA. Average 
  monthly earnings of more than $300 may indicate the ability to engage in SGA. 
  Because an individual&#8217;s entitlement to Disability Insurance benefits is 
  based on the determination that he or she cannot engage in SGA, SSA must perform 
  a continuing disability review when earnings reported to the Agency indicate 
  the beneficiary has returned to work. <br>
  <br>
  Through computer analysis, we identified 29,871 individuals (in 1 of the 20 
  segments of SSA&#8217;s data files) who were receiving Disability Insurance 
  benefits as of March 2002 and whose earnings exceeded $3,600 in any year between 
  1996 and 2000.<br>
  <br>
  FOLLOW UP OF SCHOOL ATTENDANCE BY CHILD BENEFICIARIES OVER AGE 18<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the adequacy of SSA&#8217;s procedures to ensure that child beneficiaries 
  over age 18 were entitled to receive student benefits in accordance with the 
  Social Security Act (Act).<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title II of the Act provides benefits to children of insured workers upon the 
  retirement, death, or disability of the worker. Generally, child beneficiaries 
  may continue to receive benefits until they marry or reach age 18. Amendments 
  to the Act provide for extended benefits beyond age 18 to enable child beneficiaries 
  who are full-time students at an elementary or secondary school to complete 
  their education. <br>
  <br>
  SSA relies on student beneficiaries to voluntarily report events that may affect 
  their continuing entitlement to benefits. For example, students who attend school 
  part-time or have graduated or dropped out are no longer eligible for benefits. 
  In addition, students who are married, convicted of a crime, or paid by their 
  employer to attend school are no longer eligible for benefits.<br>
  <br>
  Our prior audit work has disclosed that student beneficiaries received incorrect 
  and unsupported payments of $73.9 and $140.4 million, respectively. In response 
  to our audit, SSA redesigned its student monitoring system in June 2001. Specifically, 
  SSA revised its forms and reporting requirements, obtained school certification 
  before awarding student benefits, shifted the workload from processing centers 
  to field offices, and provided its employees additional training and guidance.<br>
  <br>
  IMPACT ON THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S PROGRAMS WHEN AUXILIARY 
  BENEFICIARIES HAVE INCORRECT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  Determine the impact on SSA&#8217;s programs when auxiliary beneficiaries have 
  incorrect SSNs on their Master Beneficiary Records.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Auxiliary beneficiaries are children, widows, spouses, and parents who receive 
  Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance benefits based on another wage earner&#8217;s 
  Social Security record. As such, the primary wage earner&#8217;s SSN&#8212;not 
  the auxiliary beneficiary&#8217;s SSN&#8212;is used to track the auxiliary beneficiary&#8217;s 
  benefit payments on the Master Beneficiary Record. <br>
  <br>
  Many of SSA&#8217;s systems use SSNs to control information about individuals. 
  For example, death reports, Supplemental Security Income records, earnings records, 
  and prisoner information are associated with the SSNs of the individuals to 
  whom the information pertains. Because this information can affect an individual&#8217;s 
  entitlement to benefits, SSA routinely matches this information and its payment 
  files to ensure payment accuracy. When SSNs are incorrect, payment accuracy 
  may be impacted since SSA&#8217;s computer matches based on SSNs would be ineffective.<br>
  <br>
  INTERIM ASSISTANCE REIMBURSEMENT TO LOS ANGELES COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, UNDER THE 
  SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME PROGRAM<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether the Los Angeles County, California, Department of Public 
  Social Services (1) calculated and deducted the correct amount of interim assistance 
  from the retroactive Supplemental Security Income payments received from SSA 
  and provided the balance to the recipient timely and (2) returned to the Agency 
  any excess amounts that could not be remitted to the recipient.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In 1974, the Congress established the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program 
  under Title XVI of the Social Security Act. The SSI program provides a minimum 
  income level to financially needy individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled. 
  Aged, blind, or disabled individuals with income and resources below established 
  limits may qualify for payments under the SSI program upon filing an application 
  with SSA.<br>
  <br>
  Many SSI applicants need financial assistance before SSA establishes SSI eligibility. 
  Therefore, States may enter into an agreement with SSA whereby the States provide 
  the individual interim assistance from State funds. Upon determining the applicant&#8217;s 
  eligibility for SSI, SSA reimburses the State or local government for payments 
  made to the recipient from State funds. If the individual is found to be ineligible, 
  SSA is not liable for the interim assistance provided by the State. This coordinated 
  Federal/State program is called the Interim Assistance Reimbursement (IAR) program. 
  During State FYs July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2001, SSA made about $460 million 
  in IAR-related payments to 38 States and the District of Columbia.<br>
  <br>
  OLD-AGE, SURVIVORS AND DISABILITY INSURANCE OVERPAYMENTS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA&#8217;s efforts to identify, prevent, and resolve Old-Age, Survivors 
  and Disability Insurance (OASDI) overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA administers the OASDI program under Title II of the Social Security Act. 
  The OASDI program provides retirement benefits to insured individuals who have 
  reached the minimum retirement age, survivors&#8217; benefits to dependents 
  of insured wage earners in the event the family wage earner dies, and disability 
  benefits to disabled wage earners and their families. <br>
  <br>
  Beneficiaries sometimes receive Social Security benefits to which they are not 
  entitled, thus creating an overpayment. For example, beneficiaries may not promptly 
  report events&#8212;such as changes in earnings or marital status&#8212;that 
  affect their entitlement to benefits. When an overpayment is detected, SSA generally 
  attempts to recover the overpayment by adjusting current benefits being paid 
  to the individual. If current benefits are not being paid, SSA may pursue collection 
  through other means, including adjusting an individual&#8217;s tax refund.<br>
  <br>
  In this review, we plan to provide an overall picture of OASDI overpayments 
  over the last 7 years by obtaining OASDI overpayment information for FYs 1996 
  through 2002 and reviewing the following:<br>
  <br>
  &#8226; overpayment amounts written off, waived, collected, etc.;<br>
  &#8226; issues that arose between 1996 and 2002 that may have caused increases 
  or decreases in overpayments;<br>
  &#8226; types of overpayments that are inherent to the design of the OASDI program 
  and cannot be changed without legislation; and<br>
  &#8226; tools and techniques available to SSA to collect OASDI overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  PAYMENTS TO STUDENT BENEFICIARIES BEYOND THE MAXIMUM AGE OF ENTITLEMENT<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the effectiveness of SSA&#8217;s controls to detect and prevent 
  payments to student beneficiaries beyond the maximum age of entitlement.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA&#8217;s Terminations, Attainments, and Student Enforcement program processes 
  all phases of student entitlement, including termination of benefits. For schools 
  that do not require enrollment each quarter or semester, student benefits are 
  payable through the earlier of (1) the second month after the month in which 
  the child reaches age 19 or (2) the month when the student completes the course 
  in which he or she is enrolled. For schools that require enrollment each quarter 
  or semester, student benefits are payable through the last month of the quarter 
  or semester in which the child reaches age 19.<br>
  <br>
  In December 1998, SSA implemented systems modifications to preclude overpayments 
  to student beneficiaries resulting from clerical errors in determining the maximum 
  age of entitlement. Generally, the maximum age for student benefits is 19 years 
  and 2 months. SSA established automated controls to prevent an end-of-school-year 
  date beyond the date in which a student reached 19 years and 2 months. However, 
  in May 2003, SSA issued Policy Instruction EM-03047, Age 19 Student Benefit 
  Reminders, which identified continuing problems and potential overpayments involving 
  student entitlement past age 19.<br>
  <br>
  REPRESENTATIVE PAYEE REPORTS INDICATING EXCESS CONSERVED FUNDS FOR SUPPLEMENTAL 
  SECURITY INCOME RECIPIENTS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate SSA&#8217;s policies and procedures for processing Representative 
  Payee Reports indicating excess conserved funds for Supplemental Security Income 
  (SSI) recipients. Specifically, we will evaluate SSA&#8217;s<br>
  <br>
  &#8226; controls to ensure all reports of excess conserved funds are forwarded 
  to SSA field offices for review and <br>
  &#8226; compliance with policies for resolving reported excess conserved funds.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Under the SSI program, resources must not be more than $2,000 for an individual 
  or $3,000 for a couple. If an individual exceeds these resource limits, benefit 
  payments to the recipient are usually suspended. Benefits are resumed if the 
  recipient&#8217;s resources subsequently fall below the limit. <br>
  <br>
  Representative payees are required to provide SSA an annual Representative Payee 
  Report accounting for how benefits were spent and how much in benefits was conserved. 
  When a representative payee reports conserved funds over $2,000, SSI eligibility 
  is questionable. Therefore, SSA must contact the representative payee to determine 
  continued eligibility. In addition, a large amount of conserved SSI payments 
  may also indicate the representative payee is not spending enough to meet the 
  recipient&#8217;s needs.<br>
  <br>
  SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS HELD IN DORMANT BANK ACCOUNTS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the extent SSA can recover Social Security funds in bank accounts 
  held by presumed dead beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  To uncover fraud, SSA and the Office of the Inspector General&#8217;s Office 
  of Investigations (OI) began an initiative to review cases of older beneficiaries 
  who have not used Medicare services for 18 months or longer. The investigation 
  criteria were set based on the belief that older beneficiaries will generally 
  seek medical services at least once in an 18-month period and generate a Medicare 
  claim. If a claim is not generated, it is possible the beneficiary has passed 
  away without SSA knowing and someone else is receiving the beneficiary&#8217;s 
  funds fraudulently.<br>
  <br>
  There have been two phases of this project. The first phase examined beneficiaries 
  who were 98 years of age or older and had not used Medicare for at least 18 
  months. The second phase is investigating beneficiaries 90 years old and older 
  who have not used Medicare for at least 18 months. In each phase, SSA staff 
  complete an initial review of the identified case and determine the beneficiary&#8217;s 
  status. If SSA cannot determine a beneficiary&#8217;s status of, the case is 
  referred to OI for further investigation. <br>
  <br>
  Through its investigations, OI has determined that some of the beneficiaries 
  are presumed to be dead and have bank accounts holding SSA funds. In these cases, 
  the beneficiaries established direct deposit for their benefits, and SSA continued 
  to deposit the beneficiaries&#8217; checks into those accounts until SSA&#8217;s 
  project identified the cases as probably deceased and suspended payments. During 
  the project, OI&#8217;s New York office identified 15 cases where the beneficiaries 
  were presumed dead, but SSA continued to deposit funds into their accounts. 
  SSA estimates that $1 million in Social Security funds have been deposited after 
  death for these beneficiaries.<br>
  <br>
  At the conclusion of OI&#8217;s investigation of these cases, SSA suspended 
  payments. However, SSA has been unable to recover the funds in the bank accounts. 
  SSA and OI have been unable to find a death certificate for the beneficiaries 
  in question. To date, SSA policy requires an official proof of death before 
  initiating a reclamation request for erroneously paid funds. Absent the death 
  certificates, the funds remain in the bank accounts. In New York, the State 
  recovers funds in bank accounts when they are inactive for 5 years and the bank 
  has been unsuccessful in contacting the account holder.<br>
  <br>
  SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME OVERPAYMENTS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA&#8217;s efforts to identify, prevent, and resolve Supplemental 
  Security Income (SSI) overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title XVI of the Social Security Act established the SSI program in 1972, effective 
  January 1, 1974, to provide income to financially needy individuals who are 
  aged, blind or disabled. SSA relies heavily upon beneficiary self-disclosure 
  of all financial resources as well as computer matching from other Federal and 
  State agencies to ensure payment accuracy. Since financial resources may vary 
  from month to month, SSI payments are error prone and may result in overpayments. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In this review, we plan to provide an overall picture of SSI overpayments over 
  the last 7 years by obtaining SSI overpayment information for FYs 1996 through 
  2002 and reviewing the following:<br>
  <br>
  &#8226; overpayment amounts written off, waived, collected, etc.;<br>
  &#8226; issues that arose between 1996 and 2002 that may have caused increases 
  or decreases in overpayments; and<br>
  &#8226; types of overpayments that are inherent to the design of the SSI program 
  and cannot be changed without legislation.</font></p>

  ADMINISTRATIVE FINALITY RULES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the impact of SSA&#8217;s administrative finality rules on Supplemental 
  Security Income (SSI) and Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) 
  overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Once SSA makes determinations regarding SSI or OASDI eligibility or payment 
  amounts, those determinations may be reopened and revised under certain conditions. 
  SSA regulations allow a determination to be reopened and revised under the rules 
  of administrative finality <br>
  <br>
  &#8226; within 1 year of the date of notice of an initial determination for 
  any reason; <br>
  &#8226; after 1 year, but within 2 years for SSI or 4 years for OASDI determinations, 
  upon a finding of &#8220;good cause&#8221;; or <br>
  &#8226; at any time, if the determination or decision was procured by fraud 
  or &#8220;similar fault.&#8221;<br>
  <br>
  SSA does not consider SSI or OASDI payments issued for any months before the 
  administrative finality time limits to be overpayments, and it does not pursue 
  recovery.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S CLEAN UP OF TITLE II DISABILITY INSURANCE 
  BENEFIT CASES WITH WORKERS&#8217; COMPENSATION OFFSET<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To report the dollar effect of errors that continue to exist in the first clean 
  up of the Title II disability workload involving a workers&#8217; compensation 
  offset.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA conducted its first clean up between July 1999 and September 2001. SSA&#8217;s 
  review consisted of 61,581 Title II Disability Insurance cases where offset 
  began during the period 1966 to 1993 and were in current pay status as of November 
  1998. However, SSA did not track the dollar errors found during the clean up.<br>
  <br>
  SSA&#8217;s Office of Quality Assurance evaluated the accuracy of the first 
  clean up process and estimated the amount of payments corrected during the clean 
  up. To determine the appropriateness of SSA&#8217;s clean-up decisions, the 
  Office of Quality Assurance tested a sample of 239 cases that were determined 
  during the clean up to have no payment error or contain either an under- or 
  overpayment.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S CONTROLS OVER THE TITLE XVI WAIVER 
  PROCESS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To (1) evaluate SSA&#8217;s controls over the Title XVI waiver process to assess 
  the appropriateness of overpayment waiver decisions of $500 or less and (2) 
  determine whether overpayment waivers exceeding $500 were developed in accordance 
  with the provisions defined in Title XVI of the Social Security Act.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title XVI of the Social Security Act established the Supplemental Security Income 
  (SSI) program in 1972, effective January 1, 1974, to provide income to financially 
  needy individuals who are aged, blind or disabled. SSA relies heavily on beneficiary 
  self-disclosure of all financial resources as well as computer matching from 
  other Federal and State agencies. Since financial resources may vary from month 
  to month, SSI payments are error prone and may result in overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  SSA grants SSI overpayment waivers under certain situations when the recipient 
  is not at fault for the overpayment. Recovery of an overpayment may be waived 
  if such recovery would be against equity and good conscience, impedes effective 
  and efficient administration because of the small amount involved, or defeats 
  the purpose of the SSI program. In December 1993, SSA changed the administrative 
  waiver tolerance from $100 to $500.<br>
  <br>
  Starting September 2001, SSA implemented the Modernized Supplemental Security 
  Income Claims System for complete processing and determination of all SSI overpayments 
  using direct Supplemental Security Record (SSR) update. Implementation of the 
  new computer system provided a significant change designed to simplify and improve 
  processing of SSI overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  Waived SSI overpayments decreased or maintained a consistent level from FY 1975 
  through FY 1993. Since FY 1993, waived SSI overpayments have increased dramatically. 
  In FY 1993, waivers of SSI overpayments totaled $2 million for one segment of 
  the SSR. By FY 2002, this amount had steadily increased to $14.3 million, and 
  FY 2003 totals are expected to exceed FY 2002 based on 10 months of available 
  FY 2003 data.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S 
  CONTROLS OVER WITHHOLDING TAXES AND SUSPENDING BENEFITS TO CERTAIN FOREIGN BENEFICIARIES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine how effectively SSA deducts taxes and suspends payment to certain 
  foreign beneficiaries living outside the United States.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA pays nearly $2 billion a year to approximately 500,000 beneficiaries living 
  outside the United States. Under 1983 amendments to the Social Security Act, 
  SSA must, with certain exceptions, withhold taxes from up to 85 percent of the 
  monthly Social Security benefit of noncitizens living outside the country. Since 
  December 1983, SSA has mainly deducted this tax from the benefits of noncitizens 
  who are not legal U.S. residents or not living in 1 of the 11 countries that 
  have tax treaties with the United States.<br>
  Furthermore, alien nonpayment provisions of the Social Security Act require 
  that SSA stop the payment of benefits to noncitizens when they leave the United 
  States for 6 consecutive months or longer. Benefits stop in the 7th month following 
  their departure. In addition, payments cannot be paid to beneficiaries residing 
  in certain countries considered hostile to the United States.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S 
  DETERMINATION OF A HIGH AVERAGE CURRENT EARNINGS FOR DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS 
  INVOLVING WORKERS&#8217; COMPENSATION<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether workers&#8217; compensation (WC) payments deemed not offsetable 
  because of a high Average Current Earnings (ACE) are accurately calculated and 
  the impact on the trust fund if Title II Disability Insurance (DI) benefits 
  are incorrectly paid.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Social Security Act requires that the combined benefits from DI and WC be 
  reduced (offset) so the combined benefits do not exceed the larger of (1) 80 
  percent of the worker&#8217;s pre-disability earnings or (2) the total family 
  benefits allowable under Social Security before an offset. Therefore, if the 
  worker receives both DI and WC but the total benefits do not exceed one of the 
  two limits, no offset will occur in DI benefits. This is referred to as a high 
  ACE. <br>
  <br>
  SSA will determine whether no offset is applicable based on WC either alleged 
  or verified. If beneficiaries allege an amount that will not result in an offset, 
  they are held responsible if such benefits change or are inaccurate and subsequently 
  result in an overpayment. <br>
  <br>
  In December 1997, the Office of the Actuary reported over 168,000 DI cases with 
  a high ACE. By December 2000, the total number had grown to over 197,000 DI 
  cases with a high ACE.<br>
  <br>
  TITLE XVI OVERPAYMENT WRITE-OFFS WHEN BENEFICIARIES ARE UNWILLING OR UNABLE 
  TO PAY, CANNOT BE LOCATED OR ARE OUT OF THE COUNTRY<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To (1) evaluate SSA&#8217;s controls over suspending collection efforts on Title 
  XVI overpayments because recipients are unable or unwilling to pay, cannot be 
  located, or are out of the country and (2) determine whether the decisions to 
  suspend collection efforts on these overpayments were in accordance with SSA&#8217;s 
  policies and procedures.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Title XVI of the Social Security Act established the Supplemental Security Income 
  (SSI) program in 1972, effective January 1, 1974, to provide income to financially 
  needy individuals who are aged, blind or disabled. SSA relies heavily on beneficiary 
  self-disclosure of all financial resources as well as computer matching from 
  other Federal and State agencies to determine benefits. Since financial resources 
  may vary from month to month, SSI payments are error prone and may result in 
  overpayments.<br>
  <br>
  SSA can terminate collection efforts on SSI overpayments in certain situations. 
  Specifically, collection efforts can be terminated when a recipient is not in 
  current payment status and previous collection efforts have determined the individual 
  is unable or unwilling to pay, cannot be located, or is out the country. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Budget and Performance 
  Integration<br>
  Our work has demonstrated that SSA is generally committed to the production 
  and use of reliable performance and financial management data, but some improvements 
  would further enhance SSA&#8217;s ability to produce accurate and actionable 
  management information.<br>
  <br>
  This area encompasses SSA&#8217;s efforts to provide timely, useful and reliable 
  data to assist internal and external decisionmakers in effectively managing 
  Agency programs, as well as both evaluating performance and ensuring the validity 
  and reliability of performance, budgeting, and financial data.<br>
  <br>
  To effectively meet its mission, manage its programs, and report on its performance, 
  SSA needs sound performance and financial data. Congress, the general public, 
  and other interested parties also need sound and credible data to monitor and 
  evaluate SSA&#8217;s performance. The President&#8217;s Management Agenda has 
  placed great emphasis on the management and performance integration of Federal 
  agencies. SSA has demonstrated a strong commitment to the Government Performance 
  and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law No. 103-62) by developing strategic plans, 
  annual performance plans and annual performance reports. However, we believe 
  SSA can further strengthen its use of performance information by fully documenting 
  the methods and data used to measure performance and by improving its data sources. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Our audits of 18 performance measures in FY 2003 found the data for 13 of the 
  measures reviewed were reliable. We concluded that the data for five of the 
  measures was found not reliable. Although the majority of performance measures 
  were determined to be reliable, our audits found that SSA had inadequate documentation 
  for 5 of its 18 performance measures regarding the methods used to measure its 
  performance. Considering the critical role of the underlying data in all of 
  SSA&#8217;s performance, financial, and data-sharing activities, it is crucial 
  that the Agency have clear processes in place to ensure the reliability and 
  integrity of its data. <br>
  <br>
  We have previously noted that SSA needs to better link costs with performance. 
  In its FY 2003 Annual Performance Plan (APP), SSA acknowledged that costs are 
  specifically aligned with outcome measures for only a few activities. SSA needs 
  to further develop a cost accounting system to better link costs with performance. 
  Since most goals are not aligned by budget account, the resource, human capital, 
  and technology necessary to achieve many performance goals are not adequately 
  described. <br>
  <br>
  In addition to performance audits, we perform and monitor audits of SSA&#8217;s 
  financial statements and other financial-related audits of SSA&#8217;s operations. 
  Our work includes comprehensive technical and administrative oversight of the 
  annual audit of SSA&#8217;s financial statements, performed by an independent 
  public accountant. We also perform reviews of the quality of single audits conducted 
  by State auditors and public accounting firms. Additionally, we conduct administrative 
  cost audits of State DDSs, which assist SSA with its disability workload. This 
  body of work helps assess the validity and reliability of the financial data 
  SSA relies on to manage its programs and meet its mission.<br>
  <br>
  The integrity of SSA&#8217;s programs and those that rely on information from 
  SSA depend on the reliability and quality of the Agency&#8217;s data. External 
  data and data exchanges are critical to SSA&#8217;s programs and are the focus 
  of many of our audits. Therefore, it is imperative that SSA&#8217;s data be 
  reliable. <br>
  <br>
  Considering the critical role of the underlying data in all of SSA&#8217;s performance, 
  financial, and data-sharing activities, it is crucial that the Agency have clear 
  processes in place to ensure the reliability and integrity of its data.<br>

  Background<br>
  The Disability Insurance (DI) program was established in 1956 under Title II 
  of the Social Security Act. The program is designed to provide benefits to wage 
  earners and their families in the event the wage earner becomes disabled. In 
  1972, the Congress enacted the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program (Public 
  Law 92-603). The SSI program provides a nationally uniform program of income 
  to financially needy individuals who are aged, blind or disabled. Disability 
  determinations under both DI and SSI are performed by a DDS in each State in 
  accordance with Federal regulations. In carrying out its obligation, each DDS 
  is responsible for determining the claimants&#8217; disabilities and ensuring 
  adequate evidence is available to support its determinations.<br>

  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To respond to the Regional Commissioner&#8217;s request to review the Connecticut 
  Disability Determination Services (DDS) Cost Allocation Plan. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Disability Insurance (DI) program provides benefits to disabled wage earners 
  and their families in the event the family wage earner becomes disabled. The 
  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides a nationally uniform program 
  of income and disability coverage to financially needy individuals who are aged, 
  blind, or disabled. <br>
  <br>
  SSA is primarily responsible for implementing the general policies for developing 
  DI and SSI disability claims. Disability determinations under both DI and SSI 
  are performed by an agency in each State according to SSA regulations. Each 
  State agency determines claimants&#8217; disabilities and ensures adequate supporting 
  evidence is available. <br>
  <br>
  SSA reimburses the States for indirect costs associated with supporting the 
  DDSs. State agencies determining disabilities for SSA are subject to Office 
  of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local 
  and Indian Tribal Governments. OMB Circular A-87 establishes basic guidelines 
  for direct and indirect costs, setting the criteria as to whether a cost is

  To review the State Disability Determination Services&#8217; indirect costs 
  to determine whether the costs claimed on the State Agency Report of Obligations 
  for SSA Disability Programs, Form SSA-4513, are allowable and properly allocated.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Disability Insurance program was established in 1956 under Title II of the 
  Social Security Act. Title II is designed to provide benefits to wage earners 
  and their families in the event the wage earner becomes disabled. In 1972, Congress 
  enacted the Supplemental Security Income program (Public Law 92-603) under Title 
  XVI of the Social Security Act. Title XVI provides a nationally uniform program 
  of income to financially needy individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled. 
  Disability determinations under the Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security 
  Income programs are performed by an agency in each State in accordance with 
  Federal regulations. In carrying out its obligations, each State agency is responsible 
  for determining the claimants&#8217; disabilities and ensuring adequate evidence

  INDIRECT COSTS CLAIMED BY THE NEW YORK DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether the indirect cost portion of the New York Disability Determination 
  Services&#8217; administrative costs claimed for the period October 1, 1999 
  through September 30, 2002 were allowable.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Disability Insurance (DI) program provides benefits to disabled wage earners 
  and their families in the event the family wage earner becomes disabled. The 
  Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program provides a nationally uniform program 
  of income and disability coverage to financially needy individuals who are aged,

  <br>
  SSA is primarily responsible for implementing the general policies for developing

  are performed by an agency in each State according to SSA regulations. Each 
  State Agency determines claimants&#8217; disabilities and ensures adequate supporting 
  evidence is available. <br>
  <br>
  SSA reimburses the States for indirect costs associated with supporting the 
  DDSs. A cognizant Federal department or agency approves a Central Office Cost 
  Allocation Plan used to accumulate indirect costs for reimbursement for Federal 
  agencies using State services. State agencies determining disabilities for SSA 
  are subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87, Cost Principles 
  for State, Local and Indian Tribal Governments. OMB Circular A-87 establishes 
  basic guidelines for direct and indirect costs, setting the criteria as to whether 
  a cost is allowable, reasonable, and allocable. It further defines indirect 
  costs and states that indirect cost pools should be distributed to the benefited

  <br>
  INDIRECT COSTS CLAIMED BY THE WEST VIRGINIA DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether indirect costs claimed by the West Virginia Disability 
  Determination Services (DDS) on the State Agency Report of Obligations for Social 
  Security Administration Disability Programs (Form SSA-4513) during Federal FYs 
  2000 through 2002, were allowable.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  State DDSs perform disability determinations under SSA&#8217;s Disability Insurance 
  and Supplemental Security Income programs. SSA pays 100 percent of the allowable 
  expenditures incurred by DDSs in making disability determinations, including 
  indirect costs. To be allowable, indirect costs must meet guidelines in Office 
  of Management and Budget Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local and 
  Indian Tribal Governments.<br>
  <br>
  Because DDSs receive Federal funding, they are subject to periodic independent 
  financial reviews under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996. Three single 
  audits reported an inability to determine that indirect costs claimed by the 
  West Virginia DDS in FYs 2000 through 2002 were allowable. The independent auditors 
  reported that the wrong indirect cost rate was used, which the DDS subsequently 
  corrected. The independent auditors also reported that the West Virginia DDS 
  did not use an accounting code available within the State&#8217;s accounting 
  system to identify indirect cost items. As a result, the independent auditors 
  could not determine whether indirect costs were also charged as direct costs.

  Background<br>
  The Office of Acquisition and Grants&#8217; mission is to direct the business 
  management aspects of SSA&#8217;s acquisition and grants management program 
  by awarding and administering contracts, preparing purchase orders or other 
  contractual instruments, and awarding and administering grants. The Office of 
  Acquisition and Grants also develops and implements policies, procedures and 
  directives for all acquisition and grants activities SSA-wide. <br>
  <br>
  For FY 2001, the Office of Acquisition and Grants awarded $460 million in new 
  contracts. SSA contract values are approximately $2 billion. <br>
  <br>
  PERFORMANCE AUDIT OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S MAIN COMPLEX 
  GUARD CONTRACT<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To ensure SSA is properly monitoring this contract and the contractor is complying 
  with the contract terms and applicable regulations.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Recent media attention and world events have spurred public and congressional 
  belief that protection of the Federal infrastructure is a high priority. Accordingly, 
  the OIG has decided to prioritize this audit work regarding physical security 
  of SSA&#8217;s main complex. Our audit will focus on reviewing the contractor&#8217;s 
  ability to meet, and its compliance with, contract requirements, including preparedness, 
  skill levels/qualifications, training, proper equipment, firearms controls, 
  and other contract areas we deem necessary to ensure the Agency&#8217;s facilities 
  are adequately protected. We will determine whether the contractor is meeting 
  its responsibilities to protect the people and property at SSA&#8217;s main 
  complex, as defined in the contract. <br>
  <br>
  PERFORMANCE MEASURE REVIEWS: AUDITS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S 
  PERFORMANCE DATA<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the reliability of the performance data SSA uses to measure selected 
  performance indicators.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Congress passed the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 to 
  bring greater accountability to Federal agencies. GPRA establishes a system 
  for strategic and annual performance planning and reporting to set goals for 
  program performance and measure results. GPRA requires that each agency create 
  (1) 5-year strategic plans, (2) annual performance plans, and (3) annual performance 
  reports. SSA released its latest strategic plan, which covers FYs 2003-2008, 
  in 2003,. The Agency&#8217;s latest annual performance plan was released in 
  May 2003. It presents the annual performance indicators and goals for FY 2004. 
  SSA established 4 strategic goals in its strategic plan and 46 GPRA performance 
  measures, with an additional 8 Program Assessment Rating Tool performance measures 
  in its latest annual performance plan.<br>
  <br>
  The success of SSA&#8217;s performance measurement initiatives hinges on the 
  quality of the data used to measure and report on program performance. Consequently, 
  it is important that SSA have assurance that the data reported are reliable 
  and meaningful and that its performance report will be useful to Congress and 
  agency management.<br>
  <br>
  As a result, the SSA/OIG will award a contract to test SSA&#8217;s performance 
  data and the systems from which it is generated to gain assurance that the data 
  reported in the performance plan are reliable and meaningful. After award of 
  the contract, the OIG will monitor the contractor to ensure the reliability 
  of the contractor's work.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">PUERTO RICO DISABILITY DETERMINATION 
  PROGRAM INDIRECT COSTS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  Our objectives are to <br>
  1. determine whether indirect costs charged to the Puerto Rico Disability Determination 
  Program (DDP) for FY 2002 were allowable and allocable; <br>
  2. identify any non-recurring indirect costs from FY 2002 that should not be 
  considered in the indirect cost rate negotiations for FYs 2003 and 2004; and 
  <br>
  3. identify and review the lump-sum accumulated leave payments for DDP retirees 
  in FY 2002. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA reimburses the Puerto Rico Department of Family&#8212;DDP&#8217;s parent 
  agency&#8212;for indirect costs associated with providing support to the DDP. 
  The Department of Health &amp; Human Services, as the cognizant agency, has 
  negotiated the indirect cost rate for all federally funded programs under the 
  Puerto Rico Department of Family.<br>
  <br>
  State agencies determining disabilities for SSA are subject to Office of Management 
  and Budget (OMB) Circular A-87, Cost Principles for State, Local and Indian 
  Tribal Governments. OMB Circular A-87 establishes basic guidelines for both 
  direct and indirect costs, setting the criteria as to whether a cost is allowable, 
  reasonable, and allocable. It further defines indirect costs and states that 
  indirect cost pools should be distributed to the benefited cost objectives on 
  bases that will produce an equitable result in consideration of the relative 
  benefits derived.<br>
  <br>
  SUMMARY OF STATE DISABILITY DETERMINATION SERVICES ADMINISTRATIVE COST AUDITS 
  COMPLETED IN FISCAL YEARS 2000 THROUGH 2003<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To summarize common findings and recommendations reported in nine Disability 
  Determination Services&#8217; (DDS) administrative cost audits and identify 
  significant issues related to oversight of the administrative costs in DDS offices. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In FYs 2000 through 2003, we completed nine DDS audits. The objectives of these 
  audits were to determine whether (1) expenditures and obligations were properly 
  authorized and disbursed; (2) Federal funds drawn agreed with total expenditures; 
  and (3) internal controls over the accounting and reporting of administrative 
  costs were adequate.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Critical Infrastructure 
  Protection and Systems Security<br>
  The information SSA needs to conduct its mission is one of its most valuable 
  assets. <br>
  <br>
  The information SSA needs to conduct its mission is one of its most valuable 
  assets. The Agency is depending on technology to meet the challenges of increasing 
  workloads with fewer resources. A physically and technologically secure Agency 
  information infrastructure is a fundamental requirement. Growth in computer 
  interconnectivity brings a heightened risk of disrupting or sabotaging critical 
  operations, reading or copying sensitive data, and tampering with critical processes. 
  Those who wish to disrupt or sabotage critical operations have more tools and 
  opportunities than ever. <br>
  <br>
  SSA has been given responsibility to protect sensitive information for virtually 
  every American. This information includes earnings data the Agency uses to post 
  earnings for 266 million wage items and medical information for millions of 
  claimants filing for disability benefits. Strong systems security and controls 
  are essential to protecting SSA&#8217;s critical information infrastructure. 
  Although no significant event has occurred to date, the level of risk is so 
  great that should something occur, it could have national security implications. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Since 1997, SSA has had an internal controls reportable condition concerning 
  its protection of information. The reportable condition came about because of 
  weaknesses in the following areas.<br>
  &#8226; Technical Security Configuration Standards<br>
  &#8226; Security Monitoring Enforcement<br>
  &#8226; Access Control<br>
  &#8226; Physical Security and Secuirty Policy for Disability Determination Services 
  Sites<br>
  &#8226; Suitability<br>
  &#8226; Continutiy of Operations<br>
  <br>
  The most important of the issues listed above is access control. As long as 
  access control to SSA&#8217;s systems is not fully resolved, the reportable 
  condition will remain. The resolution of this reportable condition remains a 
  priority for the Agency. To remedy this issue, SSA needs to perform periodic 
  reviews of everyone who has access to production data and assign data ownership 
  or responsibility.<br>
  <br>
  SSA addresses critical information infrastructure and systems security in a 
  variety of ways. The Critical Infrastructure Protection work group, created 
  in FY 2000, continually works toward compliance with Presidential Decision Directive 
  63. Presidential Decision Directive 63 and other significant legislation, requires 
  Federal agencies to identify and effectively protect their critical systems 
  and the information they hold. SSA has several other components throughout the 
  organization that handle systems security including the newly created Office 
  of Information Technology Security Policy within the Office of the Chief Information 
  Officer. SSA also routinely releases security advisories to its employees and 
  has hired outside contractors to provide expertise in this area. <br>
  In FY 2004, we plan to complete six reviews and begin one review in this area.<br>
  <br>
  We Plan to Complete the Following Reviews in FY 2004<br>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CONTROLS OVER BADGE ENTRY 
  TO SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION FACILITIES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA effectively prevents unauthorized physical access to 
  its facilities. We intend to examine SSA&#8217;s current and planned badge-based 
  personnel access systems to determine whether they grant access to only properly 
  authorized individuals and have the flexibility required to easily change or 
  revoke access authorizations.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA provides essential services to a large segment of the American public, many 
  of whom depend on those services to fill basic needs. The public at large also 
  depends on the Agency to protect the large volume of personal information it 
  uses to provide these services. If it allows access to its facilities by unauthorized 
  individuals, SSA risks either intentional or inadvertent disruption of its operations 
  and compromise of the private information entrusted to it. These risks are compounded 
  by the possible loss of public confidence that could accompany serious incidents.<br>
  <br>
  SSA&#8217;s central operations are conducted in its Headquarters complex in 
  Baltimore, Maryland. Access to buildings at its complex is controlled by the 
  use of identification badges for authorized employees, contractors, and visitors. 
  We intend to review the effectiveness of the Agency&#8217;s current and planned 
  identification badge procedures to ensure that access is limited to only those 
  individuals with valid, current authorization.<br>
  <br>
  EMPLOYEE POTENTIAL SYSTEM SECURITY VIOLATIONS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To review SSA&#8217;s policies and procedures for monitoring, resolving and 
  tracking employee potential system security violations in a timely, comprehensive, 
  and consistent manner. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA has been entrusted with some of the Nation&#8217;s most sensitive data, 
  such as SSNs and earnings records. The public expects that SSA employees protect 
  this information to the best of their ability in accordance with industry standards 
  and Government regulations. To ensure this, SSA needs to monitor its employees 
  and properly address instances where employees violate information security 
  and privacy practices.<br>
  <br>
  In a recent case involving two SSA employees charged with browsing tax records, 
  a U.S. Circuit Court judge raised a concern that SSA policies for sanctionable 
  violations may not be equitably applied. The judge&#8217;s comments were based 
  on his review of 160 other employee cases provided by the defense attorneys 
  in support of their motion to dismiss the criminal charges based on selective 
  prosecution. The judge expressed concern that some individuals in the 160 cases 
  were not treated the same as the individuals in this case, who were being prosecuted. 
  The judge advised the Assistant U.S. Attorney and the defense attorney to consider 
  a pre-trial action request rather than going to trial. <br>
  <br>
  FISCAL YEAR 2004 FEDERAL INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT ACT AUDIT<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  3rd Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA is in compliance with the Federal Information Security 
  Management Act for FY 2004.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Federal Information Security Management Act replaces the Government Information 
  Security Reform Act. It has most of the same requirements including an Agency-wide 
  information security program and annual reviews of the security program performed 
  by the Agency and the Office of the Inspector General, separately. The Office 
  of Management and Budget annually issues questions to be answered concerning 
  agencies&#8217; compliance with the Federal Information Security Management 
  Act.<br>
  <br>
  IMPACT ON NETWORK SECURITY OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S CONVERSION 
  TO WINDOWS 2000<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the effect on network security of SSA&#8217;s converting from a 
  Windows NT operating system to Windows 2000.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The computer operating systems in SSA&#8217;s data processing environment have 
  built-in security features that protect the sensitive information processed 
  and transmitted by the systems. In converting from its current Windows NT network 
  operating system to Windows 2000, SSA can maintain, diminish or enhance network 
  security. The effect of the conversion on network security depends on which 
  features are implemented and how they are used.<br>
  <br>
  Both internal and external vulnerabilities may be introduced when some of the 
  security features are weakened to allow current applications to run. As a result, 
  the integrity, completeness, and accuracy of information SSA uses could be compromised.<br>
  In addition, SSA is rapidly expanding the number and type of services it offers 
  the public through E-Government programs to comply with the President&#8217;s 
  Management Iinitiative of expanding E-Government. The integrity and confidentiality 
  of sensitive data transmitted or stored to operate these programs depends on 
  the network security configuration of the Windows 2000 operating system environment. 
  This will impact virtually all of SSA&#8217;s business functions including the 
  management of benefits and access to SSNs.<br>
  <br>
  PRESIDENT&#8217;S COUNCIL ON INTEGRITY AND EFFICIENCY PHASE IV<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To review SSA&#8217;s implementation of policies and procedures protecting its 
  physical assets.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  This is part of a President&#8217;s Council on Integrity and Efficiency Government-wide 
  review of compliance with Presidential Decision Directive 63. Phase I reviewed 
  development of policies and procedures to protect the agencies&#8217; cyber-based 
  assets. Phase II reviewed the adequacy of the agencies&#8217; implementation 
  activities for protecting its critical cyber-based infrastructures. Phase III 
  reviewed development of policies and procedures to protect the agencies&#8217; 
  physical assets. Phase IV will review implementation of policies and procedures 
  protecting the agencies&#8217; physical assets.<br>
  <br>
  PROJECT MATRIX STEP 2&#8212;REVIEW OF PHYSICAL SECURITY FOR CRITICAL ASSETS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over <br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To oversee the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office&#8217;s (CIAO) identification 
  of SSA&#8217;s interdependencies with the public and the private sector for 
  the last two critical assets to be reviewed, Headquarters and Office of Central 
  Operations/Office of International Operations/Metro West.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In response to Presidential Decision Directive 63, the National Critical Infrastructure 
  Assurance Office established the Project Matrix to coordinate analyses of the 
  Government&#8217;s dependencies on critical infrastructure. Project Matrix is 
  designed to assist select Federal agencies and Departments in prioritizing their 
  physical and cyber-assets for security enhancements.<br>
  <br>
  Step One of the matrix was to identify relevant Presidential Decision Directive 
  63 assets. Step Two of the matrix is to develop and analyze the business processes 
  associated with the assets identified in Step One to highlight significant public 
  and private sector interdependencies and points of failure.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Service Delivery <br>
  Given the complexity of the Agency&#8217;s programs, the billions of dollars 
  in payments at stake, and the millions of citizens who rely on SSA, we must 
  ensure that quality, timely, and appropriate services are consistently provided 
  to the public-at-large. <br>
  <br>
  The Agency&#8217;s goal of &#8220;service&#8221; encompasses traditional and 
  electronic services provided to applicants for benefits, beneficiaries and the 
  general public. It also includes services to and from States, other agencies, 
  third parties, employers, and other organizations including financial institutions 
  and medical providers. This goal supports the delivery of &#8220;citizen-centered&#8221; 
  services and use of &#8220;E-Government,&#8221; and therefore affords SSA opportunities 
  to advance these levels of service. Given the complexity of the Agency&#8217;s 
  programs, the billions of dollars in payments at stake, and the millions of 
  citizens who rely on SSA, the Agency is challenged to provide quality, timely, 
  and appropriate services consistently to the public-at-large. E-Government, 
  Human Capital, and the representative payee process pose significant challenges 
  that impact service delivery.<br>
  <br>
  E-Government Challenges<br>
  The PMA also calls for improved service delivery through the use of E-Government 
  in creating more cost-effective and efficient ways to provide service to citizens. 
  The increased use of E-Government will be essential to help address the Agency&#8217;s 
  expected future loss of institutional knowledge accompanied by the increased 
  services expected with the aging of the baby-boom generation. Future service 
  delivery challenges include providing electronic services over the Internet 
  and telephone, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It will be the norm for business 
  transactions to be processed electronically.<br>
  <br>
  By 2005, SSA is expected to make 60 percent of its customer-initiated services 
  available through automated telephone services or the Internet. The Agency recently 
  began allowing the public to file DI claims through the Internet to help achieve 
  its service delivery goals. SSA expects to begin a nation-wide roll-out of its 
  Electronic Disability System in 2004. There are always risks involved in conducting 
  electronic commerce, despite the Agency&#8217;s efforts to identify and mitigate 
  them. SSA will have to keep privacy and security concerns at the forefront of 
  its planning efforts. <br>
  <br>
  Representative Payee Challenges <br>
  A specific challenge in this area is maintaining the integrity of the representative 
  payee process. When SSA determines a beneficiary cannot manage his/her benefits, 
  SSA selects a representative payee, who must use the payments for the beneficiary&#8217;s 
  benefit. There are about 5.3 million representative payees who manage about 
  $44 billion in benefit payments for 6.7 million beneficiaries. While representative 
  payees provide a valuable service for beneficiaries, SSA must provide appropriate 
  safeguards to ensure they meet their responsibilities to the beneficiaries they 
  serve.<br>
  <br>
  Since FY 2001, we have completed numerous audits of representative payees. Our 
  audits identified<br>
  &#8226; deficiencies with the financial management of, and accounting for, benefit 
  receipts and disbursements; <br>
  &#8226; vulnerabilities in the safeguarding of beneficiary payments; <br>
  &#8226; poor monitoring and reporting to SSA of changes in beneficiary circumstances; 
  <br>
  &#8226; inappropriate handling of beneficiary-conserved funds; and<br>
  &#8226; improper charging of fees.<br>
  <br>
  Human Capital Challenges<br>
  Many agencies, including SSA, share the challenge to address human capital shortfalls. 
  The critical loss of institutional skills and knowledge, combined with greatly 
  increased workloads at a time when the baby-boom generation will require its 
  services, must be addressed by succession planning, strong recruitment efforts, 
  and the effective use of technology as previously discussed. <br>
  <br>
  In January 2001, GAO added strategic human capital management to its list of 
  high-risk Federal programs and operations. By 2010, workloads are anticipated 
  to increase to unprecedented volumes. Along with the workload increase, the 
  incredible pace of technological change will have a profound impact on both 
  the public&#8217;s expectations and SSA&#8217;s ability to meet those expectations.<br>
  <br>
  At current staffing levels, SSA finds it difficult to maintain an acceptable 
  level of service, especially in its most complicated workloads. After downsizing 
  and curtailing investments in human capital (people), the Government is facing 
  a major challenge to meet the current and emerging needs of the Nation&#8217;s 
  citizens. <br>
  <br>
  In FY 2004, we plan to complete 30 reviews and begin 22 reviews in this area. 
  <br>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS 
  OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S NEW SOFTWARE TESTING <br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA is sufficiently validating and testing its software 
  before placing these projects into production.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In preliminary tests, we found several instances where SSA has released software 
  to its end users without sufficient validation and testing, including the following. 
  <br>
  <br>
  &#8226; The Disability Control File was released without validation. End users 
  found the software had about 50 errors and numerous inefficiencies. End users 
  also found the software&#8217;s functionality was not as expected. <br>
  &#8226; There were 5,000 duplicate Accelerated Electronic Disability cases.<br>
  &#8226; Claims taken for Title XVI disabled individuals in the Modernized Supplemental 
  Security Income Claims System were recorded in the <br>
  <br>
  Electronic Disability Collect System as disabled children.<br>
  <br>
  The premature release of software is time-consuming for individuals processing 
  claims and is expensive for the Agency. For example, the cost of repairing software 
  defects after the software is operational is about 500 to 900 times more costly 
  than when the error is repaired in the requirements phase.<br>
  <br>
  This review will determine whether SSA finds and repairs software errors at 
  the earliest practical stage in its systems development life-cycle.<br>
  <br>
  AUDITS OF REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES FOR THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION<br>
  We will be conducting reviews in the following SSA Regions.<br>
  <br>
  REGION III<br>
  REGION IV (TWO AUDITS)<br>
  REGION V<br>
  REGION VIII<br>
  REGION IX<br>
  REGION X<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether the representative payee<br>
  1. has effective safeguards over the receipt and disbursement of Social Security 
  benefits and<br>
  2. uses and accounts for Social Security benefits in accordance with SSA&#8217;s 
  policies and procedures.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA provides benefits to the most vulnerable members of society&#8212;the young, 
  the elderly, and the disabled. Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint 
  representative payees for those beneficiaries judged incapable of managing or 
  directing the management of their benefits. Representative payees (organizations 
  or individuals) receive and manage payments on behalf of these beneficiaries. 
  Given the risk a representative payee may misuse funds and the vulnerability 
  of the beneficiaries, it is imperative that SSA have appropriate safeguards 
  to ensure representative payees meet their responsibilities.<br>
  <br>
  BEST PRACTICES FOR ELECTRONIC RECORDS AUTHENTICATION<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify leading public and private entities that successfully employ electronic 
  records management techniques for authenticating electronic records.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  This review will present information on the following methods for authenticating 
  electronic records.<br>
  1. Public Key Infrastructure&#8212;A trusted third party provides identity assurance 
  by issuing a public key certificate to the sender. This identity assurance facilitates 
  electronic transactions between entities.<br>
  2. Knowledge-based&#8212;A user answers (via computer) a set of questions that, 
  if answered correctly, authenticates their identity.<br>
  3. Captured Electronic Signatures&#8212;Users sign a signature key pad, and 
  the signature is stored electronically. In some applications, the signature 
  is authenticated.<br>
  <br>
  CONSERVED FUNDS FOR DECEASED BENEFICIARIES WITH NON-RELATED REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the effectiveness of SSA&#8217;s oversight of non-related representative 
  payees&#8217; disposition of conserved funds for deceased beneficiaries.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA provides benefits to the most vulnerable members of society&#8212;the young, 
  the elderly, and the disabled. Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint 
  representative payees for those beneficiaries judged incapable of managing or 
  directing the management of their benefits. Representative payees (organizations 
  or individuals) receive and manage payments on behalf of these beneficiaries. 
  Specifically, representative payees use Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance 
  and Supplemental Security Income benefits for the beneficiary&#8217;s immediate 
  or reasonably foreseeable needs.<br>
  <br>
  Additionally, the representative payee is responsible for conserving benefit 
  payments not needed to meet the beneficiary&#8217;s current needs. Upon the 
  beneficiary&#8217;s death, the Agency informs the representative payee that 
  the conserved benefits belong to the deceased beneficiary&#8217;s estate, and 
  those conserved funds should be turned over to the legal representative of the 
  beneficiary&#8217;s estate for disposition under State law.<br>
  <br>
  CONTROLS FOR CONCURRENTLY ENTITLED SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION BENEFICIARIES 
  WITH REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine and evaluate the effectiveness of SSA&#8217;s controls to prevent 
  different payees for concurrently entitled SSA beneficiaries.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Each year, SSA pays benefits to beneficiaries under the Title II and Title XVI 
  programs. Most beneficiaries receive benefits from only one program. Concurrently 
  entitled beneficiaries, however, receive benefits from both programs.<br>
  <br>
  SSA policy requires that personnel appoint one payee for all benefits to which 
  the beneficiary is entitled unless there is some compelling reason to do otherwise. 
  SSA policy also requires that each claims file be documented with the reason 
  for naming different payees in those rare instances where different payees will 
  be appointed for a beneficiary who is entitled to more than one benefit. Where 
  different payees are appointed, field offices should prepare a diary for a manual 
  accounting report to be obtained on the Title II claim, when appropriate, because 
  the system only sends an accounting report to the Title XVI representative payee.<br>
  <br>
  CONTROLS OVER THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S PROCESSING CENTER ACTION 
  CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether Processing Center Action Control System (PCACS) transactions 
  are properly controlled and resolved in accordance with established SSA business 
  priorities and standards and are accurately reported to SSA management.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  PCACS distributes workload items to appropriate program service center (PSC) 
  personnel for control and resolution. PCACS receives workload items through 
  mail, fax, and electronic data transmission. The bulk of each PSC&#8217;s annual 
  workload is formed by a multitude of electronically generated items from more 
  than 40 different computer processing sources, such as Benefit Rate Increases, 
  Returned Check Action Program, Critical Payment System, and Automated Earnings 
  Reappraisal Operation. PCACS receives these items electronically via batch processing 
  and then electronically distributes the items to the PSCs based on SSN jurisdiction. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, PCACS tracks the age and status of each item, and these data items 
  are used to calculate workload and productivity reports for management reporting 
  purposes.<br>
  <br>
  During its FY 2002 and 2003 financial statement audits, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
  LLP noted<br>
  &#8226; alert suppression was not consistent between PSCs and was not independently 
  reviewed to determine the correctness of the suppression; <br>
  &#8226; complaints regarding the handling of transactions were not clearly tracked 
  to provide information on their resolution or trends; and<br>
  &#8226; standard management reports did not always reflect the true aging of 
  items and did not reflect the amount of time items spent in hold categories. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Additionally, previous OIG audits determined that not all alerts were sent to 
  the PSCs for resolution, and PSCs did not resolve all alerts sent to them.<br>
  <br>
  EFFICIENCY OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S ACCELERATED ELECTRONIC 
  DISABILITY SCANNING PROCESS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify improvements and cost savings in the planned scanning process of 
  disability documents into the Accelerated Electronic Disability (AeDib) electronic 
  folder.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The AeDib system&#8217;s electronic folder includes two types of data: structured 
  and unstructured. Structured data include information keyed into the Electronic 
  Disability Collect System or SSA&#8217;s mainframe. Unstructured data include 
  images of documents that have been scanned into the Document Management Architecture. 
  This audit will focus on the unstructured data resulting from the document scanning 
  process.<br>
  <br>
  We believe there may be substantial cost savings in the planned scanning process 
  of disability documents. A contractor estimated that SSA will spend $375 million 
  over a 10-year period to scan disability documents into the AeDib electronic 
  folder. One element that resulted in this high estimate was the size of the 
  disability case folders. The contractor determined that disability case folders 
  average 250 pages per case file when hearings are needed for the final adjudication.<br>
  <br>
  SSA is planning an in-line rather than an end-of-line scanning process. SSA&#8217;s 
  in-line scanning process will be achieved by having evidence from medical providers 
  sent directly to a contractor for scanning into the Document Management Architecture. 
  We expect to achieve cost savings in this process by identifying improvements 
  in the process and reducing the number of documents scanned into the electronic 
  disability folder.<br>
  <br>
  EVALUATION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S ACCELERATED ELECTRONIC 
  DISABILITY SYSTEM&#8212;FIFTH ASSESSMENT<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA&#8217;s project management of its Accelerated Electronic 
  Disability (AeDib) System will enable the Agency to meet the project&#8217;s 
  expected functionality, including systems security, while complying with laws 
  and regulations pertaining to system development efforts.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The AeDib project is the Agency&#8217;s technological approach to automating 
  the disability claims process. AeDib is expected to assist the Agency in finding 
  innovative ways of meeting the challenge of increasing workloads in the future. 
  The AeDib initiative will replace the paper claims folder with an electronic 
  record that can be accessed by all case processing components. For example, 
  AeDib is expected to <br>
  <br>
  1. eliminate the need to print, mail, store and reconstruct the paper claims 
  folder; <br>
  2. stop keying the same information at multiple case processing locations; <br>
  3. control and assign work from electronic queues rather than paper folders; 
  and <br>
  4. ensure disability files are available when an appeal is filed or a continuing 
  disability review is due. <br>
  <br>
  We have completed four assessments in our ongoing evaluation of the AeDib project. 
  As part of our fourth assessment, we had concerns involving (1) the AeDib sponsors&#8217; 
  participation in the project; (2) the process used in validating the system; 
  (3) data security at the State DDSs; (3) the cost of scanning paper disability 
  documents into the AeDib system; and (4) the reduction in the functionality 
  of AeDib.<br>
  <br>
  INVENTORY REVIEW AT THE NATIONAL RECORDS CENTER<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine the accuracy and condition of the physical and computerized inventories.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA uses historical information from case folders for a variety of reasons, 
  such as new claims, appeals, attorney reviews and litigation, and continuing 
  disability reviews. SSA&#8217;s ability to promptly react to the needs of its 
  customers is often directly dependent on retrieving historical information from 
  case folders. SSA stores case folders at three major folder storage locations: 
  the Rolling Heights Megasite, Wilkes-Barre Folder Servicing Operation, and National 
  Records Center.<br>
  <br>
  SSA stores about 24 million Title II case folders at the National Records Center. 
  An SSA contractor files, retrieves, and maintains case folders and updates the 
  electronic inventory system.<br>
  <br>
  MANAGEMENT ADVISORY REPORT&#8212;FISCAL YEAR 2003 QUICK RESPONSE ACTIVITIES 
  SUMMARY REPORT<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To summarize the results of our responses to special inquiries received in FY 
  2003.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  In addition to conducting audits and evaluations, we respond to special inquiries. 
  These efforts are short-duration, time-sensitive projects that address requests 
  from Congress, senior SSA officials, other Federal agencies, beneficiaries, 
  union leaders, and others.<br>
  <br>
  MANAGEMENT OF ALLEGATIONS BY THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S OFFICE 
  OF SYSTEMS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate SSA&#8217;s Office of Systems&#8217; (OS) management of allegations 
  and determine whether all allegations that should have been referred to the 
  OIG were referred.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA receives various types of allegations related to its programs, its employees, 
  and the misuse of Social Security numbers. While SSA may receive allegations 
  directly, the OIG also refers allegations it receives through its Hotline to 
  SSA.<br>
  <br>
  SSA has policies and procedures for handling allegations. For example, allegations 
  concerning potential criminal violations by SSA employees and non-employees 
  are generally referred to OIG. Allegations concerning other types of potential 
  violations, such as potential violations, concerning ethics or equal employment 
  opportunity issues are generally referred elsewhere. <br>
  OS manages the development, acquisition, and use of SSA's information technology 
  resources that support the Agency's program and business functions. Allegations 
  concerning OS employees or functions detected in or received by OS are significant 
  because of the potential impact on SSA&#8217;s information system infrastructure 
  and programs. Our review will focus on how OS manages allegations and whether 
  all allegations that should have been referred to OIG were referred.<br>
  <br>
  OFFICE OF INVESTIGATIONS ASSISTANCE&#8212;REVIEWS OF REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES&#8217; 
  OPERATIONS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To provide assistance to the Office of Investigations and U.S. Attorney&#8217;s 
  Office in determining whether representative payees properly accounted for the 
  Social Security benefits received on behalf of the individuals in their care.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The OIG&#8217;s Office of Investigations periodically opens investigations of 
  representative payees and requests that we review bank records to determine 
  whether the representative payees may have used Social Security benefits for 
  purposes other than for the individuals in their care.<br>
  <br>
  OPERATIONS OF THE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS MEGASITE<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To review the operations of the Megasite, including its case folder inventory 
  system.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  The Office of Hearings and Appeals&#8217; Appeals Council reviews administrative 
  law judge decisions appealed by claimants and on its own motion. The Council 
  decides approximately 100,000 cases per year. Hearing offices send case folders 
  with unfavorable or partially favorable decisions to a Megasite in Springfield, 
  Virginia, where they are stored from 6 months up to 2 years. Approximately 200,000 
  case folders are stored at this site. Folders are shipped between the Office 
  of Hearings and Appeals in Falls Church and the Megasite. The ability of the 
  Megasite&#8217;s physical and computer inventory tracking system to accurately 
  and quickly identify and locate the claimant&#8217;s folder and shelf position 
  is critical to find folders and ensure effective, equitable, and timely processing 
  of appealed claims.<br>
  <br>
  SUITABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS SERVING AS REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES<br>
  Planned Start<br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA had adequate controls to identify and prevent individuals 
  who had Representative Payees from serving as payees for other beneficiaries.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint representative payees to receive 
  and manage beneficiaries&#8217; payments if the beneficiary cannot manage or 
  direct the management of their benefits because of their youth or mental and/or 
  physical impairments. Payees can be appointed for Old-Age, Survivors and Disability 
  Insurance (OASDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries and may 
  be an individual or an organization. <br>
  <br>
  About 7.6 million individuals have payees&#8212;approximately 4.5 million are 
  OASDI beneficiaries, 2.3 million are SSI recipients, and 800,000 are entitled 
  to both OASDI benefits and SSI payments. <br>
  <br>
  We have previously reported that beneficiaries who had payees themselves were 
  serving as representative payees, despite SSA&#8217;s policy prohibiting this 
  practice. In response to a November 17, 2001 report, SSA implemented a control 
  in the representative payee System to produce an alert when a representative 
  payee application is completed if the payee applicant has an assigned payee. 
  This alert was designed to prevent the completion of such a representative payee 
  application. Additionally, SSA initiated a review of over 4,600 potential instances 
  of beneficiaries with Payees who were also serving as represetative payees. 
  This work was performed in two phases. Phase I started September 24, 2001 and 
  identified 3,809 cases. Phase II started June 24, 2002 and identified 835 cases.<br>
  <br>
  SUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR 2002 OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AUDITS OF REPRESENTATIVE 
  PAYEES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify and summarize common findings and recommendations from the OIG&#8217;s 
  audits of representative payees.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Some individuals cannot manage or direct the management of their finances because 
  of their youth or mental and/or physical impairments. Congress granted SSA the 
  authority to appoint representative payees to receive and manage these beneficiaries&#8217; 
  payments. A representative payee may be an individual or an organization. SSA 
  selects representative payees for Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance 
  beneficiaries or Supplemental Security Income recipients when representative 
  payments would serve the individual&#8217;s interests. Representative payees 
  are responsible for using benefits in the beneficiary&#8217;s best interests.<br>
  <br>
  In FY 2002, we conducted audits of seven representative payees. These audits 
  found similar conditions at the representative payees, which we will summarize 
  and report to SSA.<br>
  <br>
  SUMMARY OF FISCAL YEAR 2003 OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AUDITS OF REPRESENTATIVE 
  PAYEES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To identify and summarize common findings and recommendations from the OIG&#8217;s 
  audits of representative payees.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S 
  COLLECTION OF TITLE II OVERPAYMENTS MADE TO REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES AFTER THE 
  BENEFICIARY&#8217;S DEATH<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess the effectiveness of SSA&#8217;s Old-Age, Survivors and Disability 
  Insurance (OASDI) overpayment collection efforts for payments issued to representative 
  payees for deceased beneficiaries. <br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  SSA administers the OASDI program under Title II of the Social Security Act. 
  The OASDI program provides protection against the loss of earnings as a result 
  of retirement, death or disability. According to SSA&#8217;s 2001 Supplemental 
  Statistical Analysis, in 2000, the Agency paid over $400 billion to more than 
  45 million Title II beneficiaries, and more than 10 percent of the beneficiaries 
  had representative payees.<br>
  <br>
  SSA relies on the representative payees to report events to SSA that may affect 
  the individual&#8217;s entitlement or benefit payment amount. These events can 
  include marriage, change in living arrangements, death or incarceration. If 
  a representative payee fails to notify SSA of such an event, the beneficiary 
  may be issued an overpayment. It is SSA&#8217;s responsibility to identify and 
  pursue recovery of the overpayment. This recovery process becomes more difficult 
  when the beneficiary receives benefits through a representative payee.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S 
  EFFORTS TO ADDRESS FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To assess SSA&#8217;s plans to address its future workforce needs to manage 
  workloads and continue to provide quality customer service.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Strategic Management of Human Capital is a Government-wide initiative and is 
  included in the President&#8217;s Management Agenda. Moreover, the General Accounting 
  Office has designated strategic human capital management as a high-risk area. 
  The Agency faces its own internal &#8220;retirement wave,&#8221; with the projected 
  loss of over 38,000 SSA employees to retirement and attrition over the next 
  decade. At the same time, SSA expects to face explosive workload growth as the 
  baby boom generation ages and becomes more prone to disabilities.<br>
  <br>
  Based on the results of its analysis of its employee base and the individuals 
  it serves, SSA has established a multi-faceted response to meet its human capital 
  challenge. SSA has identified those staff positions that will incur the most 
  serious losses due to retirement. To reduce the impact caused by these losses, 
  SSA has implemented various career development programs and developed its succession 
  plan. Additionally, the Agency has established a 5-year Future Workforce Transition 
  Plan to help guide SSA from the workforce of today to the workforce needed for 
  the future. To provide the kind of service that has been the Agency&#8217;s 
  hallmark, SSA recognizes it must maintain a highly skilled, high-performing, 
  and highly motivated workforce. Although SSA has taken many steps to meet its 
  human capital challenge, SSA needs to ensure it meets its service delivery goals.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S PROCEDURES FOR ADDRESSING EMPLOYEE-RELATED 
  ALLEGATIONS<br>
  We will be conducting reviews in the following Regions.<br>
  <br>
  REGION II<br>
  REGION III<br>
  REGION IV<br>
  REGION VI<br>
  REGION IX<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To evaluate the adequacy of SSA&#8217;s policies and procedures for addressing 
  employee-related allegations, determine how well SSA complied with those policies 
  and procedures, and determine whether SSA actually referred all employee-related 
  allegations that should have been referred to the OIG.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Every year, SSA receives various types of allegations related to its programs 
  and the misuse of SSNs. While SSA may receive allegations directly, the OIG 
  also refers allegations to SSA that it receives through its Hotline. For FYs 
  2000 through 2002, the OIG referred 876 employee-related allegations to SSA. 
  Of this number, 665 were sent to SSA&#8217;s regional offices.<br>
  <br>
  Allegations concerning employees are significant because of the potential losses 
  to SSA&#8217;s programs and the corresponding negative public impact such issues 
  can have. Our review will focus on the development and resolution of OIG referrals 
  of employee-related allegations received during FYs 2001 through 2002 and on 
  allegations or instances of employee misconduct brought to the attention of 
  the Regional Offices through other sources.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S PROCEDURES TO IDENTIFY INCARCERATED 
  REPRESENTATIVE PAYEES<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  1st Quarter FY 2004<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To ensure SSA has adequate procedures to identify when representative payees 
  are incarcerated so new representative payees can be selected.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Congress granted SSA the authority to appoint representative payees to receive 
  and manage beneficiaries&#8217; payments if the beneficiary cannot manage or 
  direct the management of their benefits because of their youth or mental and/or 
  physical impairments. Payees can be appointed for Old-Age, Survivors and Disability 
  Insurance (OASDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries and may 
  be an individual or an organization. <br>
  <br>
  About 7.6 million individuals have payees&#8212;approximately 4.5 million are 
  OASDI beneficiaries, 2.3 million are SSI recipients, and 800,000 are entitled 
  to both OASDI benefits and SSI payments. <br>
  <br>
  We have previously identified representative payees who were allowed to continue 
  to manage beneficiaries&#8217; funds despite being incarcerated. To address 
  this issue, SSA implemented policies prohibiting prisoners from serving as representative 
  payees. SSA also implemented procedures to identify representative payees when 
  they become prisoners. If a prisoner is found to be a representative payee, 
  a new payee should be selected.<br>
  <br>
  THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION&#8217;S REPRESENTATIVE PAYEE SELECTION PROCESS<br>
  Planned Start <br>
  Carry Over<br>
  <br>
  Objective<br>
  To determine whether SSA field office (FO) personnel are adequately determining 
  whether a representative payee is needed.<br>
  <br>
  Background<br>
  Some individuals cannot manage or direct the management of their finances because 
  of their youth or physical and/or mental impairments. For such people, Congress 
  provides that payments be made through a representative payee, who receives 
  and manages the beneficiary&#8217;s payments.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SSA has a legal obligation
    to make proper determinations concerning beneficiaries&#8217; capability
  of managing their own funds. The decision to make payment through a representative
  payee is serious since it deprives the beneficiary of direct control over his
  or her finances and may affect his or her manner of living. SSA is to be alert
  to evidence indicating the need for representative payment because the beneficiary
  is incapable of managing his or her own funds. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Section GN 00501.015 of
    SSA&#8217;s Program Operations Manual System (POMS)
  states that FO personnel are responsible for (1) deciding the capability of
  individuals to manage their benefits and (2) appointing representative payees
  (when incapability is found). When deciding the capability of a beneficiary,
  staff should weigh all the medical, legal and lay evidence obtained during
  the disability determination process. Further, POMS, section GN 00502.020,
  states that whenever &#8220;&#8230;a question of capability is raised, the
  capability decision must be documented.&#8221;</font></p>
